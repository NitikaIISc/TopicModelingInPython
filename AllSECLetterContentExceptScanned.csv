Honorable Gary Gensler 
Chairman November 17, 2022 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
100 F Street, NE 
Washington, DC 20549 
Dear Chairman Gensler: 
As we discussed during the Senate Banking Committee's September 15th hearing, I am 
concerned about the negative effects that the Commission's proposed rule for, ""The 
Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors,"" may have on 
agricultural producers covered by a public company's indirect ""Scope 3"" disclosure 
requirements. I continue to hear concerns from Montanans in production agriculture about the 
unnecessary red tape this regulation could create. 
As a working farmer, I understand both the importance of considering the impacts of 
climate change, as well as the importance of access to capital and markets to sell and produce 
· agricultural products. I appreciate our discussions and your response that the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) does not intend for public companies to have an obligation to ask 
producers for information to estimate these emissions. However, the SEC should not take any 
action that may lead, intentionally or unintentionally, to burdensome reporting requirements for 
production agriculture when their goods are part of the supply chain for a publically traded 
company. 
America's family farmers and ranchers face many challenges in the marketplace as they 
work to feed the world. That's why it is critically important to avoid adding any unnecessary red 
tape. I stand ready to work with you to ensure we are listening to rural communities and 
preventing any rules from including unintended consequences. Thank you for your attention to 
this important matter.

Subject: THANK YOU for requiring corporate climate risk disclosure!



Dear Chairman Gensler,

I'm a mother who grieves the loss of the natural world.

I'm writing today to commend you for your recent decision to require the largest corporations to disclose their climate risks.

This rule is a huge step forward. By requiring massive companies to account for their carbon the same way they account for their cash, you are not only acknowledging that environmental destruction is a major financial risk, but also that the future of our planet is just as important (indeed, far more so) than corporate profits.

I echo the words of Ilmi Granoff, director of Sustainable Finance at the Climateworks Foundation, on this rule: ""It's awesome, it's very cool, and it's long overdue.""

Thank you for delivering this great victory for our planet and its people over profits, and please continue to take action to combat corporate greenwashing and help ensure the true costs of corporate pollution are accounted for.

Sincerely,

Sheila Fowks

Sheila Fowks"

Release N o. 33-11042, 34-94478; File N o. S7 -10-22 
Dear Ms. Countryman: 
I am writing with a supplement— Corporate Leaders Measuring, Disclosing & Reducing Scope 3 
Emissio ns—to Ceres’ response to the SEC’s March 21, 2022 proposed rule, The Enhancement 
and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors.  
In Ceres’ June 17, 2022 response to the SEC’ s proposed rule, we endorse the proposed Scope 
3 disclosure requirement. We discu ss statement s from Cere s Investor Networ k members, the 
TCFD, FSOC, the EPA and other s about the importance of Scope 3 assessment and 
disclosure. W e also submitted a “Statement of Essential Principle s for SEC Climate Change 
Disclosure Rulemaking” on behalf of over 500 investors, companies, foundations, NGOs, and 
individuals that states, “Disclosure rule s should include Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas 
emissions, which are needed to asse ss the full range of climate change ri sks facing 
companies ”.  
Most rec
ently, the IFRS’ International Sustainabilit y Standard s Board (ISSB) announced “the 
ISSB voted unanimousl y to require compan y disclosure s on Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 
greenhouse ga s (GHG) emissions, applying the current version of the GHG Protocol Corporate 
Standard. A s part of these requirements, the ISSB will develop relief provision s to help 
companie s apply the Scope 3 requirements.” The announcement noted that the ISSB intends to 
issue fi
nal climate and general sustainabilit y disclosure standard s as early as possible in 2023. 
Because the IFRS’ accounting standards are used by regulator s in over 140 countries , and 
because of IOSCO’ s support for the ISSB’ s efforts , we believe it likel y that the ISSB’ s Scope 3 
disclosure requirement s will be adopted globall y in coming years. 
We are submitting thi s collection of article s because they represent busine ss leadership in 
measuring, disclosing, and reducing Scope 3 emissions and reflect the ri sks investor s face from 
not having a clear picture of Scope 3 emissions . These companie s have set science-based 
targets set to reduce emissions, including Scope 3 emissions produced by a company’s supply 
chain or use of its products and services. CDP has found that GHG emissions in a company’s 
supply chain are, on average, 11.4 times higher than its op erational emissions.1 Because of the

provide additional background and resources if it would be useful.

""e public comment period for the
draft SEC rule closed on June 17.""is article re#ects some of the keypoints that WRI and ConcordiaUniversity shared in our respectivecomments with SEC. 
""e proposed rule would require
companies to disclose 
Scope 1
emissions (from direct sources) and
Scope 2 emissions (from purchasedelectricity, heat or steam), whereas
it would require disclosure of 
Scope
3 emissions (from other sources in
the value chain) when deemedmaterial to investors or when thecompany has emissions targets thatencompass Scope 3 emissions. Butscope 3 emissions are animportant source of climate-related !nancial risk across thebusiness value chain and shouldbe reported by all registrantsunder the SEC proposed climatedisclosure rule. 
Scope 3 emissions account for the
largest share of most companies’
GHG emissions, and investors
report that Scope 3 estimates are

de!nition of !nancial materiality.
""e SEC’s proposed approach aimsto “balance the importance of scope3 emissions with the potentialrelative di$culty in data collectionand measurement.” But manycompanies already estimate scope 3emissions, and the 
SEC’s
procedures for disclosing material
assumptions and uncertainties in
!nancial accounting could beapplied to scope 3 emissionestimates. 
Scope 3 emissions
account for 75% ofcompanies’ greenhousegas emissions on average 
""e CDP estimated that Scope 3
emissions account for an average of
three-quarters of a company’semissions. But the importance ofScope 3 emissions variesconsiderably by sector and canapproach 100% of a company’semissions (Scope 3 emissions wereestimated to be 99.98% on averagefor companies in the !nancialservices sector). Other studies showthat the 
supply chains of eight
sectors account for half of theworld’s GHG emissions andprovide evidence that 
Scope 3
emissions from energy-intensive
industries are increasing faster thantheir Scope 1 and 2 emissions.10/25/22, 12 38 PM Trends Show Companies Are Ready for Scope 3 Reporting with US Climate Disclosure Rule  World Resources Institute
Page 5 of 14 https //www wri org/update/trends-show-companies-are-ready-scope-3-reporting-us-climate-disclosure-ruleCounterarguments emphasize the
importance of Scope 3 emissions inunderstanding climate-related!nancial risks, facilitating actualemissions reductions within thevalue chain, preventing companiesfrom claiming lower emissions andrelated liabilities by outsourcingcarbon intensive activities (i.e.,‘moving’ emissions from Scope 1 or2 to Scope 3), and preventingcompanies from skirtingresponsibilities to be transparent totheir shareholders about theiroverall risk exposure, which isespecially relevant for industrieswith a majority of their emissionsclassi!ed as Scope 3. Proponentsalso point to existing Scope 3
accounting practices and
advancements in Scope 3 datacollection as enablers of Scope 3disclosure.
""e debate over importance versus
accounting challenges for 
Scope 3
emissions was evident in public
consultations conducted by theTask Force on Climate-relatedFinancial Disclosures (TCFD) in2021. TCFD surveyed andobtained feedback from 100climate-disclosure users, 106climate-disclosure preparers, and 46other respondents.

For over two decades, companies

Although Scope 3 emissions can
require assumptions, rely onimperfect estimation methods, andare uncertain, this is no di% erent

reliable !nancial reporting. Withsimilar process controls overestimation of Scope 3 emissions,checked by an independent auditor,companies should be able toprovide investors informative dataon how dependent their full valuechains are on emissions and their

By James McCall, Chief Sustainability Oﬃcer
In 2021, HP announced a range of ambitious climate action targets, including a commitment to be
net zero by 2040 — a full decade ahead of the Paris Agreement. We’ve published our SustainableImpact Report for over 20 years and have actively worked to reduce our footprint for decades.That’s because it’s in our company’s DNA to push toward the goal of being the most sustainableand just tech company in the world.
We’ve had many successes. Last year HP was one of only 14 companies worldwide, and the sole
tech ﬁrm, to receive a prestigious Triple A rating in Climate, Water, and Forest benchmarks fromthe not-for-proﬁt Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) — our third year in a row. And becauseconsumers care about their footprint and want their purchases to have a positive impact, whetherthey’re buying a new computer, printer, or co ﬀee machine, sales related to our sustainability e ﬀorts
have more than tripled, hitting $3.5 billion in ﬁscal year 2021.10/25/22  12 42 PM C mate Act on for Supp ers He ps Ma e HP s Supp y Cha n More Susta nab e  News D rect
Page 3 of 6 https //newsd rect com/news/c mate act on for supp ers he ps ma e hps supp y cha n more susta nab e 932793285But we realize there is more to be done to reach our goal of cutting our absolute greenhouse gas
emissions 50% by 2030, which means minimizing Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions across our end-to-endvalue chain.
Scope 1 emissions are from HP’s direct operations. Scope 2 are indirect emissions, such as the
electricity that powers our operations. Scope 3 relates to activities not controlled by HP, such as“upstream” emissions from our supply chain and “downstream” emissions from customer use of ourproducts. Together, Scopes 1, 2, and 3 represent the cradle-to-grave emissions of our products,and nearly all our emissions (99%) are Scope 3, with almost 70% of those coming from our supplychain and 30% from customer use.
Tackling Scope 3 emissionsWith our supply chain representing over two-thirds of our emissions, our mandate was clear: To
reduce the footprint of our printers, computers, and monitors, we had to reduce the footprint ofthe components, manufacturing, assembly, and transportation of those items. We have hundreds ofsuppliers, so we needed to take a data-based approach to this problem. We examined our supplychain data and found that our 30 largest partners were responsible for nearly 80% of the Scope 3emissions from our directly-contracted-suppliers operations. If we could assist those 30 companiesin becoming more eco-friendly, the results would be far-reaching. To help these suppliers reachthe next level of success, we leaned into the philosophy of “If you give a man a ﬁsh, you feed himfor a day. If you teach a man to ﬁsh, you feed him for a lifetime.” Not only would helping thesuppliers help HP, but it would beneﬁt their bottom line, other customers, the communities wherethey operate, and the planet as a whole. So we got to work.
Sharing knowledgeBecause HP has stressed responsible sourcing, human rights, and sustainability as part of our
supplier selection, many of our partners already had a strong base but needed extra support.Building o ﬀ our real-world learnings within HP, we partnered with them to create environments
where they could adopt long-lasting environmentally conscious approaches that would be best fortheir unique businesses.
Over the last two years, HP has brought in top-tier environmental groups such as the CDP and
World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to host virtual workshops for those 30 suppliers. Participants learnedabout energy e ﬃciency, renewable energy, setting science-based targets, external reporting, and
more.10/25/22  12 42 PM C mate Act on for Supp ers He ps Ma e HP s Supp y Cha n More Susta nab e  News D rect
Page 4 of 6 https //newsd rect com/news/c mate act on for supp ers he ps ma e hps supp y cha n more susta nab e 932793285At the same time, we asked our partners to disclose their footprint using CDP Supply Chain
reporting tools. Nearly 200 suppliers (representing over 95% of our yearly spending) are currentlydoing so. This transparency helps HP better understand our footprint and informs the broader techindustry utilizing this supply chain.
Tackling the restThe results have been incredible: Twenty of our top 30 suppliers have formally committed to
setting meaningful greenhouse gas reduction targets following the Science Based TargetsInitiative. We are also proud that 100% renewable electricity now powers the ﬁnal assembly of over95% of our worldwide PC and display products. HP and our supply chain partners are makingsubstantial progress, but there’s still much more to do. It’s vital that we address the “upstream”supply chain adding to our footprint. However, we cannot reach net zero without also tackling the30% of our emissions generated during the ongoing customer use of our products. The good newsis that customers are actively seeking sustainable choices on shelves, online, or as part ofenterprise purchase for printers, computers, and monitors. Our goal is to help them do just that—tomake the home, o ﬃce, or hybrid work setup of the future the most sustainable ever.
How HP is building a sustainable and ethical supply chain
Hundreds of suppliers make up HP’s supply chain — one of the largest in the IT industry — and the
company’s commitment to make ethical, sustainable, and resilient products protects its businessand brand, strengthens customer relationships, and creates opportunities to innovate.
Raw materialsHP works with peers across the IT industry to engage the entire supply chain in e ﬀorts to eradicate
minerals that directly or indirectly support armed groups and to promote responsible sourcing of
minerals regardless of origin. In the European Union, for example, we support the Conflict MineralsRegulation, which focuses on responsible smelter sourcing regardless of country of mineral origin,including conflict-a ﬀected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs) worldwide.
Components
We summarize supplier performance using Sustainability Scorecards, designed to incentivize
suppliers and drive ongoing improvement through consistent, comprehensive, and actionablefeedback. The results contribute to a supplier’s overall procurement score, which impacts theirrelationship with HP and ongoing business.10/25/22  12 42 PM C mate Act on for Supp ers He ps Ma e HP s Supp y Cha n More Susta nab e  News D rect
Page 5 of 6 https //newsd rect com/news/c mate act on for supp ers he ps ma e hps supp y cha n more susta nab e 932793285Final assembly
In collaboration with NGO partners and other external organizations, we provide programs
designed to help suppliers continually improve along their sustainability journey. These programsfocus on areas such as worker well-being, rights and responsibilities, and environmental, health,and safety (EHS) awareness. In 2021, there was a 114% increase in factory participation in HP’sSupply Chain Sustainability Programs.
LogisticsWe partner with logistics suppliers that have the same environmental mindset as HP to provide
solutions to reduce CO2 impact, such as biofuels for ocean freight and electric vehicles for roadfreight. We are also investigating Sustainable Aviation Fuel for air freight. Additionally, in the UnitedStates, HP is a Gold Level Sponsor of Truckers Against Tra ﬃcking (TAT), which helps combat human
traﬃcking by educating and mobilizing our trucking supplier network, in coordination with law
enforcement agencies.
DistributorsOur Amplify Impact program invites partners to help drive meaningful change across the global IT
industry. Partners that pledge will tap into our extensive knowledge, training, and resources toassess and work to improve their own sustainability performance. To date, 1,400 channel partnershave been trained, educated, and empowered through HP Amplify Impact.
Retail sale / Customer useHP Planet Partners is the company’s return-and recycling program for computer equipment and
printing supplies. HP ink and LaserJet cartridges returned through HP Planet Partners go through amultiphase “closed loop” recycling process. Recycled plastic from empty cartridges is used tocreate new Original HP cartridges and other everyday products.
Post-sale / End-of-useWe develop services that aim to keep products in use longer, o ﬀer service-based solutions, and
recapture products and materials at end of use. For instance, through our HP Device Recovery
Service we buy used devices securely to give them new purpose, extend their life spans, andreduce negative environmental impact. Customers receive reverse logistics, data sanitization with acertiﬁcate, a sustainability beneﬁt report, and the fair-market value of the device.10/25/22  12 42 PM C mate Act on for Supp ers He ps Ma e HP s Supp y Cha n More Susta nab e  News D rect

RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTION & CONSUMPTION SUPPLY CHAIN & THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY10/25/22  12 45 PM An nterv ew w th Un ever
Page 2 of 11 https //www susta nab ty com/th n ng/an nterv ew w th un ever/
Plan was launched in 2010 with a focus on
improving the health and wellbeing of people,reducing environmental footprint, and enhancinglivelihoods for millions. The company recentlyannounced plans to achieve net zero emissionsfrom all products by 2039 and 100 percentrenewable energy across its operations by 2030.
 
Emily Farnworth, Global Director of Low CarbonEconomy Transition at ERM, recently spoke withMarc Engel, Chief Supply Chain Officer at Unilever,who leads Unilever’s key initiatives to reduce thecompany’s global carbon footprint to find out thesecret of their success.
 
Emily Farnworth: What does a net zero goal mean for
Unilever?
Marc Engel: For Unilever, the drivers behind net zero are
all about responding to the climate crisis and creating asocially inclusive world. As a company, we care aboutimproving the health of the planet for citizens of society.10/25/22  12 45 PM An nterv ew w th Un ever
Page 3 of 11 https //www susta nab ty com/th n ng/an nterv ew w th un ever/
We realize we need to get through the COVID-19 crisis, but
we also need to show our understanding that climatechange and social inequality are still important, and that westill have net zero as a global goal.
Our internal driver is business with a purpose
, but there are
also external factors. Brands with a purpose grow faster.
But having a purpose is not possible if we don’t care aboutthe health of our planet and the citizens of our society.
The notion that the benefit of the product is only for the
individual is changing as consumers are driving businessesto be more socially and environmentally responsible. As aresult, those companies that are leading in sustainabilityare gaining more preference from customers, investors,and employees, and this is a way that they will remain‘future fit.’
Business needs to go first to raise the ambition to reach
net zero by 2050.
What response do you see from your consumers in
relation to your net zero ambition?In a net zero environment, the
social component and theregeneration of nature are closelylinked together.
10/25/22  12 45 PM An nterv ew w th Un ever
Page 4 of 11 https //www susta nab ty com/th n ng/an nterv ew w th un ever/
There are two consumer groups that are most engaged
with the topic. We find that millennials are much moreaware, and they follow brands that are more sustainable aslong as no additional cost is incurred.
Generation Z is totally driven by sustainability, and this
steers their buying decisions. Sustainability is the price ofrelevance; without this, you’ll lose Gen Z’s attention. Thebaby boomers are disinterested, and Generation X is onlyjust starting to get it.
Another indicator of changing attitudes has been a major
shift in talent acquisition trends, where employees andpotential candidates want to see a bigger purpose from thecompany. This is a marked change from ten years ago.
What are the critical steps you have taken to achieve
your net zero goal?
We started from the inside out. We’ve been taking action
since 2018, and our carbon footprint has shrunk by about70 percent in our internal operations.We are taking a clear four-part
approach to putting our net zeroaction plan into place.
10/25/22  12 45 PM An nterv ew w th Un ever
Page 5 of 11 https //www susta nab ty com/th n ng/an nterv ew w th un ever/
However, our operations are only 5 percent of our total
carbon footprint.   The majority of emissions come from
across our value chain, which includes Scope 3 upstreamand downstream. About 30 percent of our total carbonfootprint is from our customers. Upstream, we have agreater influence on our suppliers, but downstream wehave far less influence on how our customers use ourproducts.   
 
With electricity we have reached a tipping point forrenewable power. We see that the market is there andprogress has been made. 
In 2016, we implemented an internal carbon price. Based
on the factory footprint, we were able to calculate the costof carbon and put that into an investment fund to makeenergy savings. Energy used per metric ton of product wasreduced by 26 percent.
The more challenging part in our operations has been
converting out of gas. We are converting a lot to biomass,but we need to make sure we’re not contributing to aThere is no excuse for any
company not to convert to greenenergy now – everyone should beable to do that across markets.

problem here. Financial payback on energy savings
projects is very good usually – typically under two or threeyears.
What has enabled you to make progress?Unilever is driven to reach our net zero target, and we
recognize that there are some key critical aspects to beingsuccessful.
What has worked well is making the commitment and
trusting that our managers would develop creativesolutions that will be financially viable in terms of costs andpaybacks.
Unilever also has a CEO who really believes in this
commitment. Commitment from the top is essential, andyou need to live and breathe the commitment from the toplevel to make it work.Ten years ago, we made the
commitment to our UnileverSustainable Living Plan. Backthen, we didn't know how wewould achieve it, and no othercompany our size had launchedsuch an ambitious plan.
10/25/22  12 45 PM An nterv ew w th Un ever
Page 7 of 11 https //www susta nab ty com/th n ng/an nterv ew w th un ever/
Sometimes the younger generation has a greater
understanding of the value of innovation, but without toplevel commitment, it’s difficult to move. It should be seenas an investment with a return, not merely a cost.
What challenges do you anticipate you might face as
you continue to push to net-zero?
We have had a smooth ride on progress through our
operations for the past 12 years. It has been great to cutemissions in our operations, but only three to five percentof our total emissions has been reduced.
Our suppliers also need to be on the net zero journey. 
Consumers also need net zero behaviors in their own life
which is a big challenge. Part of this is having moreawareness about the day-to-day choices they make andunderstanding how these choices impact the carbonfootprint.  Unilever wants to see the carbon
footprint noted on the invoices,just like we see nutritionalinformation noted on consumableproducts.
10/25/22  12 45 PM An nterv ew w th Un ever
Page 8 of 11 https //www susta nab ty com/th n ng/an nterv ew w th un ever/
With 48,000 suppliers on the journey to a bigger goal, they
have a large implementation challenge to declare afootprint on everything. They need to know whatinterventions to make, what responsibilities to take, andwhat resources are needed to understand theinterconnection.
This becomes a balance between the carrot and the stick,
and involves business development, working together, andgiving credit publicly to those who do it. 
There are many initiatives focused on reducing carbon
emissions in the digital tech world. Partnerships withorganizations such as the World Business Council onSustainable Development are essential. The cost to go italone would be prohibitive for Unilever, and for success weneed the support of many. 
What is your advice to other companies that are
currently going through this process?We need to help suppliers
understand that it's not a cost, it'san investment, and howimplementation will make themmore competitive.
10/25/22  12 45 PM An nterv ew w th Un ever
Page 9 of 11 https //www susta nab ty com/th n ng/an nterv ew w th un ever/As a first step, I advise companies to map their own carbon
footprint. Artificial intelligence is getting better at accurateextrapolation to help with this.
Also, look for easy strategies for saving energy - the
cheapest and cleanest options are sometimes not those inuse, and you will quickly get pay back from energy costsavings. Once you’ve done it yourself, you're more credibletalking to your suppliers when you need them to do thesame.
Develop products that are green and that don’t
compromise on functionality. Provide consumers with thebenefit that by using the product, they will save time andlower their carbon footprint – it’s important to marry thetwo.   Consumers won’t purchase the product without the
benefit, so create a way to promote time and conveniencewhile reducing energy consumption.  
Looking ahead to 2040-2050, what are your biggest
challenges and opportunities?
One of our biggest opportunities and challenges is the
need to finish off the deforestation work and look atregeneration of nature as it is part of our net zero strategy.
Alternative fuels are also important. There is a particular
view on the role of hydrogen and what it will be. It is veryinfluential. We are in the process of switching to electricvehicles as part of our commitment to the EV100 initiative.10/25/22  12 45 PM An nterv ew w th Un ever
Page 10 of 11 https //www susta nab ty com/th n ng/an nterv ew w th un ever/Options for short-range distances are great, but not great
in the long-distance range, as it’s not obvious where weneed to go there.
Another challenge for Unilever is in the reformulation of our
products such as laundry products. We also use a lot ofplastic, which comes from petrochemicals. This will be achallenge for us in the next ten years. It is a big part of ourjourney.
What role do partnerships play?Unilever has had success with EV100, RE100, and other
coalitions where we can work with others to find solutionsfor electric vehicles and renewable power. Microsoft ishelping us map our data, but turning it into useful insight isdifficult.
There is a very big market for the type of consultancy
provided by ERM. We are seeing there is sometimes a lackof ownership around how to implement strategies that aredeveloped at a high level. Consulting on the technicalimplementation is a big part of partnership.
Collaboration is what the world needs. The alignment of
climate, nature, and social livelihoods – these three thingsare difficult to mind map but are vital.

GAP INC CASE STUDY
Exceeding Energy-Efficiency Goals with
Supplier Participation 
In 2017, Gap Inc. pledged to save 10 billion liters of water by 2020. Taking its 2014
usage as a baseline, the retailer became involved with the Clean by Design program asa way to meet this considerable goal. Because Clean by Design consists of 10 bestpractices, it is proven and yields measurable impact results and return on investment tothe mills, while being easy to understand, adopt and execute. Gap Inc. recognized that
Clean by Design would be low-hanging fruit for its suppliers to save water, so thecompany started proactively nominating its strategic facilities to participate.

saving 11.2 billion liters of water since 2014 – 10.2 billion with resource energy-efficiency programs and 1 billion through processing and product innovation. Withoutquestion, the Clean by Design program played a significant role in Gap’s outstandingfigures.
How Gap Did It
Gap had been working with Clean by Design, which was first administered by the
Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), since 2013 and had nominated facilitiesfor each Clean by Design cohort. During the years of implementing Clean by Design,Gap intensified its involvement in sustainability, later serving as one of the founding10/25/22  12 47 PM Case Study  Gap nc  Exceed ng Energy Eff c ency Goa s w th Supp er Part c pat on  Appare  mpact nst tute
Page 3 of 10 https //appare mpact org/gap nc case study exceed ng energy eff c ency goa s w th supp er part c pat on/members of Aii. In the early years, a unified approach to sustainability programming
was missing from the industry. Aii’s management of the Clean by Design programchanged that by promoting partnership, collaboration and transparency.
Between 2013 and 2021, Gap has nominated 52 facilities to participate in programs,
including Clean by Design, Clean by Design Plus, Chemistry & WastewaterManagement (in India) and Carbon Leadership. These facilities, which are responsiblefor Tier 1 (finished product assembly) and Tier 2 (material production) of the supplychain, have been located in Mainland China, Vietnam, India, Pakistan and TaiwanRegion.
Thanks to these broad-reaching efforts, Gap has reported significant reduction in
carbon, energy and water. Even better, the results provided the company with multiplesynergistic benefits. While Gap had entered the Clean by Design program as a way tosave water, the company soon realized that it was also saving energy, making it wellpositioned when setting science-based targets for Scope 3 GHG reduction
“Gap understands that efficiency programs are a win-win, good for the brand and good
for our suppliers because saving energy and water results in cost-savings,” said Agata
Smeets, Director of Global Sustainability at Gap.  10/25/22  12 47 PM Case Study  Gap nc  Exceed ng Energy Eff c ency Goa s w th Supp er Part c pat on  Appare  mpact nst tute

Development for Aii
Implementing the Clean by Design program didn’t just benefit Gap’s efficiency efforts
and suppliers’ bottom lines. The company’s work has supported the industry’sexpansion of standardized impact programs globally.
In fact, Gap has taken a leadership role, along with Aii, in piloting the initiatives for
program expansion to India, Vietnam and Taiwan Region.   Gap also championed and
drove the development of Aii’s Clean by Design+ program, which supports wetprocessing facilities ready for more advanced-level programming.10/25/22  12 47 PM Case Study  Gap nc  Exceed ng Energy Eff c ency Goa s w th Supp er Part c pat on  Appare  mpact nst tute
Page 5 of 10 https //appare mpact org/gap nc case study exceed ng energy eff c ency goa s w th supp er part c pat on/“The Clean by Design partnership is flexible and focused on always improving and
expanding,” said Aaron Tam, Senior Manager of Gap’s Environmental Capability
Building team . “We understood that some facilities were ready for more and just needed
support, so we were excited to be able to offer that. Likewise, we knew that meeting ourambitions SBTs would take more than just going after that low-hanging fruit.”
The Future
Gap’s priorities remain focused on water, climate and waste, and Aii’s programs are
vital for meeting the brand’s climate goals. The company has been working along withAii on strategies to meet its Scope 3 SBTs (30% of GHG emissions from 2017 baselineby 2030).10/25/22  12 47 PM Case Study  Gap nc  Exceed ng Energy Eff c ency Goa s w th Supp er Part c pat on  Appare  mpact nst tute

now also expanding their programs to include additional impact initiatives to aggregaterenewable energy procurement and   coal phase-out projects – key levers in our climate
strategy,” said Smeets. “Our advice would be to just start. When we started, we wereflying by the seat of our pants, and Clean by Design was a credible program that helpedus structure our supply chain strategies.”
Today, launching and joining collective impact programs in different geographies is a lot
easier than it once was. When Gap first started doing this environmental work, thecompany had to develop and run its own programs because none were available incertain geographies.
“With Aii, we were able to fold these programs into one another,” said Smeets. “We
created an aligned approach, invited other brands to participate and introduced Aii toadditional service providers like environmental consultants who could help put Aii’sobjectives into action on the ground.”  
Thanks to convenors like Aii, standardized metrics and aligned methodologies are more
available and transparent, making results more predictable and replicable. Collectiveaction   is now recognized as the way to reach climate goals.
“It’s important to not underestimate communication channels with your suppliers thatyou’re nominating for these programs,” said Tam. “A supplier’s mindset is key toachieving success and results, and provides great programs through which to approachsuppliers to urge them to undertake this work.”10/25/22  12 47 PM Case Study  Gap nc  Exceed ng Energy Eff c ency Goa s w th Supp er Part c pat on  Appare  mpact nst tute

Page 2 of 8 https //www susta nab ty com/th n ng/an nterv ew w th ford/Mary Wroten: Before announcing our net zero commitment,
we were committed to reducing our CO  emissions in linewith the Paris Agreement goals. We found that peopleoutside of the sustainability space did not know whatParis-aligned meant, but they were a lot more familiar withwhat it meant to become carbon neutral. With thisrealization, we tapped a cross-functional team to develop amethod through which we could commit to Paris andcommunicate this commitment in a manner that resonateswith our customers and key stakeholders.
It took about a year for our team to come up with an
answer as it’s not as simple as just picking a commitmentand date. It was important for us to understand where ouremissions came from so we knew where we should start.We also benchmarked ourselves against other companiesto compare and contrast our commitments and actions.From there, we considered a myriad of different factors andquestions: What would energy availability look like throughto 2050? If we are to go the electric vehicle (EV) route, isthere enough electric capacity and related infrastructure topower our vehicles? How do we address technologyconcerns like battery costs and range? How do we addressdifferent consumer needs like charging requirements, rangelimitations, and so on?
From these considerations, we came to our net zero
commitment, which is housed in three main buckets: First,our net zero by 2050 commitment. Second, we set 2035science-based targets for our vehicles and facilities andmade other mid-term announcements. Lastly, the actions210/25/22  12 48 PM An nterv ew w th Ford

breaking down your commitment into manageablesteps and actions?
In the automotive industry, for example, EV charging
infrastructure is not built out to the extent needed for thetransition. At Ford, we are bypassing this whole argumentby making the vehicles and partnering with electricitycompanies to help build all of the elements that arerequired to make the EV transition happen.
AB: Scope 3 emissions are a big part of Ford’s carbon
footprint. What are the key challenges you face withScope 3 emissions and how are you planning toaddress them?MW: When you set your long-term
goal, that is your North Star. Thenyou have to break that goal intointerim actions. Companies skipover the “act now” piece becauseit is hard to do some things today.

MW: We address Scope 3 by tackling our biggest
emissions categories first. Those categories are the use ofour vehicles (75 percent of our Scope 3 emissions) and oursuppliers’ emissions (17 percent). Everything else will beaddressed over time. Would we like to address 100 percentof our emissions? Absolutely, and we will over time, but ourimmediate focus is to address our biggest sources first.
To address our vehicle emissions, we are electrifying our
most iconic vehicles, we are shifting our entire productportfolio to clean energy, and we are considering carboncapture and sequestration. There is not a one-size-fits allsolution for suppliers, but we do require suppliers to reporttheir emissions and set science-based targets through ourSupplier Code of Conduct and terms and conditions.
AB: So far in your net zero journey, what have been
your biggest challenges?
MW: The last time our industry was disrupted this much
was when we went from horse and buggy to the internalcombustion engine. Now we are going from internalcombustion engine to electrification, so we have to rebuildeverything all over again and learn from the successes andfailures of prior technologies.  10/25/22  12 48 PM An nterv ew w th Ford
Page 5 of 8 https //www susta nab ty com/th n ng/an nterv ew w th ford/
One part that we have not really dived into yet is bringing
the customer along in the transition. If the customers arenot a part of this journey, the automakers will make greatvehicles but no one will want to buy them. In order tochange that, we need to get customers into the vehicles.When a customer experiences a vehicle and sees how easyit is to charge at their house, and how easy they fit intotheir lifestyle, they will want to buy one.
AB: With COP26 upcoming, what do governments need
to be doing more of to encourage EV adoption? Whatwould Ford like to see?First, we need to make sure our
vehicles are zero emissions. Thenwe need to make sure the grid iszero emissions because our netzero commitment is a well-to-wheel commitment, and we needto ensure we reduce both theemissions of our products and theenergy used to propel ourproducts.
10/25/22  12 48 PM An nterv ew w th Ford
Page 6 of 8 https //www susta nab ty com/th n ng/an nterv ew w th ford/MW: We expect to see more companies set net zero goals
globally to keep the world within 1.5°C of global warming.We are hoping to see countries contributing more financialsupport to those most vulnerable to climate change. Wealso hope to see all countries uniting and working togetherto achieve the net zero future that we need to have. Rightnow, Europe is the ideal model for government action fromboth the supply and demand perspectives to incentivize EVadoption.
AB: What is the role of partnerships and collaboration in
achieving net zero?
MW: Partnerships and collaboration are so critical because
no one company can achieve net zero by themselves. Thisis why Ford has collaborated and developed strategicpartnerships in order to help us achieve net zero all theway down to raw material extraction.
We joined 
IRMA (Initiative for Responsible Mining
Assurance) and the Responsible Business Alliance, and
we invested in Redwood Materials (an EV battery recycling
company). We are also focused on industry partnerships. Inthis space, we work with 
Drive Sustainability in Europe
and the Automotive Industry Action Group in the U.S.
AB: What do you think is your biggest success so far onyour journey to net zero?
MW: First is making the commitment. When we first made
ours, it made people uncomfortable because we did nothave every aspect figured out yet. It is okay to not have10/25/22  12 48 PM An nterv ew w th Ford
Page 7 of 8 https //www susta nab ty com/th n ng/an nterv ew w th ford/
everything figured out, but it was so important to set a
North Star and have the recognition from our leadershipteam. Just by having our leadership commit to the net zerogoal without having clarity of every single step was asuccess. And now we are determining the steps and weknow it will take time to get all of the answers, and that isokay.
AB: Do you have any advice for companies who are still
trying to bring their leaders on board?
MW: Use data – not just for GHG emissions for your
company but external data from the IntergovernmentalPanel on Climate Change (IPCC) and data about climatechange in general. You need to zoom out and look at theplanet and what changes are happening.
A lot of the education for our leaders happened when we
developed our scenario analysis report. In the report, wetook the two words of climate change and connected themto what it might mean for Ford and our customers.Companies need to do a scenario analysis to understandthe implications of climate change to the planet, to theirindustry, and to their business. This will help make climatechange and its impacts real to their executive teams.
AB: Did you have any final thoughts you wanted to
share?10/25/22  12 48 PM An nterv ew w th Ford

Sustainability professionals are always talking about how
urgent a transition to a sustainable future is. And while it isurgent, it takes time to figure everything out. You want todo things right, and you want to make sure you land on theright solution. MW: A sustainable future is a
journey, and it will not all happenovernight. Set the North Star andthen figure out how you are goingto accomplish your goal. Beambitious and make peopleuncomfortable.

  General Mills Partners with Regrow Agriculture to Monitor Agriculture at
  Scale
Business WireMINNEAPOLIS -- June 14, 2022Today, General Mills and Regrow Agriculture announced a multi-year partnership
to monitor agricultural practices and their environmental impacts across 175million acres of farmland in North America, Europe, and South America. Onehundred and seventy-five million acres represents General Mills’ estimatedsupply sheds – the regions where the company sources its key ingredients, likewheat, oat, and dairy. Within the total acreage being monitored, General Millssources its ingredients from roughly three million acres of farmland eachyear.
Regrow Agriculture supports General Mills’ commitments to advance regenerative
agriculture on one million acres of farmland by 2030, reduce absolutegreenhouse gas emissions – 60 percent of which are from agriculture – acrossits value chain (scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 30 percent by 2030, and ultimatelyachieve net zero emissions by 2050.
General Mills will leverage Regrow Agriculture’s software platform,
Sustainability Insights, and its technology and data capabilities, includingOperational Tillage Information System (OpTIS) andDeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), to monitor trends and estimate impactswhere regenerative agriculture principles are being advanced on farmland.
OpTIS is a remote sensing technology that uses satellite imagery to monitor
and verify regenerative agriculture techniques, such as tillage reduction andcover-crop adoption. The information from OpTIS is then fed to DNDC, whichmodels nutrient cycling in the soil to estimate changes in net greenhouse gasemissions.
Regrow Agriculture’s dynamic monitoring and modeled outputs will integrate
with General Mills’ existing regenerative agriculture and climate trackingsystems. The collaboration will also enable General Mills to update its keyingredient emission factors and deliver a more accurate emissions baseline.Emission factors will be updated annually and will incorporate estimated10/25/22  12 49 PM Genera  M s Partners w th Regrow Agr cu ture to Mon tor Agr cu ture at Sca e  B oomberg

land-use. General Mills and Regrow detailed this new approach to improvingcorporate climate inventories in a white paper with SustainCERT earlier thisyear.
“We believe regenerative agriculture is the most promising solution to reach
our climate goals and create positive planetary outcomes,” said Mary JaneMelendez, chief sustainability and global impact officer. “As we advanceregenerative agriculture, quantifying the environmental outcomes is essential.Our goal is to show how outcomes, like soil health and carbon sequestration,improve as farmers transition to regenerative agriculture systems. We haveconfidence that through our partnership with Regrow Agriculture, we can trackthe advancement of regenerative agriculture at scale, benefitting GeneralMills and the broader industry, as well as understand trends in adoption andwhere to bring future investment.”
In 2018, General Mills and Dagan, now Regrow Agriculture, launched a pilot to
understand tillage reduction and cover-crop adoption in Western Manitoba,Canada, and North Dakota oat supply sheds. Regrow’s OpTIS technology remotelysensed crop residue and plant growth to document prevalence of tillagereduction and cover-crop adoption. This farm management information was thenfed to the DNDC data model to estimate changes in net greenhouse gasemissions. In 2021, General Mills and Regrow Agriculture partnered to scalemonitoring of agricultural practices and greenhouse gas emissions reductionsfor the entire state of Kansas. These two projects helped shape General Mills’regenerative agriculture and greenhouse gas measurement and reportingstrategy, ultimately leading to this expanded partnership.
“We are excited to support General Mills’ leadership of a supply shed-based
approach to corporate scope 3 emissions and commitment to direct impactmonitoring and modeling to deliver on their net-zero goals,” said AnastasiaVolkova, chief executive officer, Regrow Agriculture. “Regrow’s scalablescience and technology platform continues to serve agriculture and foodindustries, bringing transparency and scalability to monitoring, andmeasurement of greenhouse gas emissions.”
General Mills and Regrow Agriculture will also explore joint research
opportunities to add additional insights into the platform over time, likewater quality, biodiversity, and supply chain resiliency. The partners plan toshare insights from their new approach with other interested stakeholders overthe next several years. The two organizations see opportunity for additionalcompanies to adopt a similar approach to supply shed impact quantification andhope the collaboration sparks collective action to accelerate regenerative andclimate-resilient agriculture movements.

(52.2% of the total IKEA value chain footprint in FY21)
The materials with the largest climate footprint
The biggest portion of the IKEA climate footprint comes from raw material extraction and
processing materials used in the IKEA range. To reduce our climate footprint, we focus onthe materials we use the most and those that have the largest climate footprint: wood,metals, paper, textile furnishings and plastics, representing 90% of our material needs andclimate footprint.
Although wood represents the largest material share, metals have a higher climate
footprint since they are more energy-intensive to produce. As a result, we aim tosigniﬁcantly increase recycled metal content while securing that for all materials, we have acomplete portfolio of actions to reach the required reductions by 2030. To reduce thepressure on the world’s forests, we have set a new goal to use one third recycled wood inIKEA products by 2030.HÅLLBAR waste bins are made

All climate footprints are not yet heading in theright direction. Since FY20, the climate footprintof materials has increased by 15%. The mainreason is that sales recovered as the IKEAbusiness recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic –increasing the amounts of products sold and thematerials used. Compared to the baseline FY16the footprint is now 13% higher.12.1 11.8 13.6
In FY21, VÄRLDSKLOK, a plant-based mince, was launched. Aswith HUVUDROLL, our plant-based meatball alternative,VÄRLDSKLOK is based on pea-protein and will provide asimilarly small climate footprint.

Page 4 of 14 https //about ea com/en/susta nab ty/va ue cha n c mate footpr ntIn FY21, IKEA restaurants and other foodservice touchpoints continued to operate at a
reduced capacity, while the Swedish Food Markets remained open. This impacted theoverall sales of food, which in turn reduced the absolute climate footprint. A betterindicator for FY21 is tracking the development of the relative climate footprint per kg foodingredient (excl. sold drinking water), which has decreased by 13.4% since the baselineFY16.
The positive development in relative measures is supported by trends in the share between
plant-based and meat-based food options.
The volume of beef and pork sold in relation to other food decreased from 15% in FY20to 14.3% in FY21.
Compared to our meat-based balls, the sales of plant balls and veggie balls in ourrestaurants increased from 11% to 14% in sales quantity and from 13% to 24% in theSwedish Food Market, mainly due to the launch of the plant ball.
Compared to the meat-based hotdogs, the number of veggie hotdogs sold in the bistroincreased from 10% to 13%.

compared to the baseline year FY17. However, compared to the previous FY20, the absoluteclimate footprint increased by 12.9% due to more transports as the world started to recoverfrom the COVID-19 pandemic.
The relative emissions per shipment stayed at more or less the same level compared to last
year. On a positive note, our land transport relative emissions decreased by 2.2% comparedto FY20 due to an increase in intermodal solutions from 41% to 45%. We also managed tomaintain the ﬁlling rates of our containers.
However, during FY21, the progress in using biofuels in ocean shipping did not meet our
expectations. This was mainly due to the turbulence in the transportation industry andconstant network adjustments, followed by high cost pressures from the supply chainchallenges. Consequently, the overall share of alternative fuels decreased from 3.3% to0.8%.

Page 7 of 14 https //about ea com/en/susta nab ty/va ue cha n c mate footpr ntWhile the climate footprint from IKEA retail and other operations is still larger than baseline
FY16, it decreased compared to the previous year. This is mainly due to an increase in theshare of renewable electricity from 64% to 73% between FY20-21. This is especially true inretail markets where we achieved 100% renewable electricity in FY21 (Canada, Denmark,Estonia, France, Russia, Slovenia, Spain: the Canary and Balearic Islands), and marketswhere we made signiﬁcant progress, such as the United Arab Emirates (+24.3% percentagepoints).
However, the share of renewable energy for the non-electric energy consumption –
heating, cooling and fuels – decreased from a 17% renewable energy share in FY20 to 15%in FY21, compared to 17% in the baseline FY16. This decrease is mainly driven by retailexpansion, where new stores don’t have 100% renewable heating and cooling solutions inplace.
We are working to secure that we only consume renewable electricity by 2025. We are also
addressing energy used for heating and cooling that requires large investments intechnologies such as ground and air source heat pumps and biogas or biomass boilers.10/25/22  12 51 PM We are comm tted to reduc ng our c mate footpr nt

The climate footprint from customer travel and home deliveries decreased by 0.9% in FY21
compared to FY16. During FY21, the goal to install charging stations at all stores in 32markets was reached.
Although the share of deliveries made via electric trucks increased from 9.6% to 11%, the
climate footprint from home delivery increased by 46% in absolute terms between FY20and FY21. This is mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, online shopping and customerdemand for delivery.Goal for 2030: To reduce the

The second-largest part of the IKEA climate footprint after materials comes from the
electricity needed for lighting and home appliances in our customers’ homes. A small partof the climate footprint comes from gas-driven hobs, refrigerants used for refrigeratorsand freezers, and the burning of candles.
Since FY20, the climate footprint from product use at home has decreased by 3%, mainly
due to improved energy e#ciency of our LED bulbs and despite an increase in sales as theIKEA business started to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The share of renewable electricity that our customers are using has increased by 5%

“Science-based targets provide a robust

“By defining types of emissions and the

An industry shi!
Companies that have set science-based targetsare starting to significantly reduce the direct andindirect emissions from their operations, knownas a company’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
British Land, which reduced its Scope 1 and 2
emissions by 73 percent between 2009 and 2020,has announced science-based targets for afurther 51 percent reduction by 2030, as part of asustainability strategy that includes a net zerotarget for all its o!ices and real estate by 2030.

reduce emissions 51% by 2030, and a long termtarget to achieve 95% by 2040 from a 2018 baseyear. For JLL, scope 1 emissions arise mostlyfrom the operation of our vehicle fleet; scope 2emissions result mainly from the operation ofour o!ice portfolio; and the vast majority of ourscope 3 emissions come from the operation ofthose buildings which we manage on behalf ofour clients.
JLL’s target is certified to the Net-Zero Standard,
which brings the latest climate science to net-zero target setting. It is the first global science-based standard to guide organizations settingnet-zero targets and encourage them to followthe principles of the mitigation hierarchy.E!ectively, this means that companies should
prioritize implementing strategies to reduce theiremissions before engaging in emissionsabatement through carbon sequestrationprojects or purchasing carbon o! sets.
“The environmental impact of the builtenvironment means that changes in the realestate sector can have a significant influence onemissions reduction, ” says Batten. “Usingscience-based targets has given a rigor to howfirms report operations data and makeassessments to understand how they can10/25/22  12 54 PM How sc ence based targets are he p ng rea  estate shr n  ts carbon footpr nt

“Many real estate firms have capitalized on
implementing the most straightforwardmeasures to improve e!iciency in their ownbuildings and within their own operations.Further progress to reduce emissions across thevalue chain will require larger interventions, andthat’s where science-based targets have a realimpact, ” says Batten.
By focusing on Scope 3 emissions, science-based
targets push companies to consider emissionsthroughout their supply chain, from constructionto procurement and beyond.
For JLL, with over 96% of its emissions arising
from the consumption of natural gas andelectricity in the real estate managed for clients,collaboration is fundamental. “Taking all clientson their own climate action journeys is critical, ”adds Batten.
JLL has invested in the continued development
of products to provide a broader complement ofglobally scalable, consistent services to meet asurging demand from investors, occupiers andcity leaders. This more comprehensive suite ofservices is supported by a robust JLL technologyplatform, enabling greater automation, trackingand management.10/25/22  12 54 PM How sc ence based targets are he p ng rea  estate shr n  ts carbon footpr nt

Page 3 of 13 https //cap ta mon tor a /sector/consumer/scope 3 gm dr v ng pace/The auto industry has a troubled relationship with
sustainability. An April report from management
consultancy McKinsey revealed the industry is far
from embracing ESG.
Although most suppliers of parts to car manufacturers
(83%) now have deﬁned sustainability targets, only 7% areactually starting to implement carbon emissions-abatement programmes.
This is not helped by the fact that some car manufacturers
themselves have had their heads in the sand.
In early April, for instance, Germany’s Volkswagen (VW)
rejected a shareholder proposal from seven European
investors that wanted details of how the German carmanufacturer’s lobbying activities help it address climaterisks.
Others are merely tinkering around the edges. In mid-May,
BMW 
splashed a deal with BASF, the world’s largest
chemical producer, to use a more sustainable paint thatcuts emissions by 40% per coating layer, and reduces theamount of carbon dioxide emitted in the plants by morethan 15,000t by 2030 –  a tiny fraction of the 200 milliontonnes the Munich-based car manufacturer hasGeneral Motors has asked suppliers to commit tocarbon neutrality, social responsibility programmesand sustainable procurement practices.

GM has been putting its money where its mouth is. At the
start of this year, it said that it would invest $7bn in four
factories in Michigan to expand its electric vehicle (EV)battery and electric truck manufacturing capacity (at thetime creating 4,000 new jobs); it said that it would convertsites in Tennessee and Ontario to focus on EV-relatedmanufacturing.
Both are part of the group’s $35bn investment programme
in EVs between 2020 and 2025. It also announced a three-year $750m investment programme for EV chargingfacilities across the US and Canada.10/25/22  12 57 PM How GM s sett ng the pace for Scope 3 reduct ons  Cap ta  Mon tor
Page 7 of 13 https //cap ta mon tor a /sector/consumer/scope 3 gm dr v ng pace/Signing the Scope 3 pledge
At the end of April, GM went one step further. The largest
global automotive company to do so, it decided to tackleScope 3 emissions – those connected with a company butoutside its direct control – by asking suppliers to committo carbon neutrality, social responsibility programmesand sustainable procurement practices.
It has joined car manufacturers like Japan’s Honda, which
was, in 2012, the ﬁrst car company to target and publishScope 3 emissions, and its compatriot Toyota, which in2015 said that it would reduce all emissions throughoutthe life cycle of its cars by 25% by 2030.
Other car manufacturers have made Scope 3
commitments, but they are not as far-reaching.
BMW, for example, is looking for a 20% cut in Scope 3
emissions from upstream suppliers by 2030 but althoughit has committed to being climate-neutral by 2050, it doesnot deﬁne what this means in terms of reductions.
VW is particularly amorphous. Although it has committed
to reducing the total life-cycle emissions intensity ofvehicles by 30% between 2015 and 2025, these will beachieved by carbon offsets. It is notable that at 
Cop26 in
Glasgow last year, VW refused to commit to the same zero-tailpipe emissions that GM did.
The pledge is a commitment for them to achieve Scope 1
and 2 carbon neutrality by 2025 for suppliers that are10/25/22  12 57 PM How GM s sett ng the pace for Scope 3 reduct ons  Cap ta  Mon tor

2038 for raw materials and logistics. Paris-based providerof business sustainability ratings EcoVadis is managingthe process.
This has long been seen as the industry’s Holy Grail. In a
LinkedIn post at the end of May, Angela Hultberg, globaldirector in the sustainability team at Chicago-basedmanagement consultancy Kearney, 
called Scope 3
emissions “the next frontier” in the automotive industry.
Although Fred Gersdorff, GM’s senior manager of socially
responsible and sustainable supply chains, tells Capital
Monitor  that “there’s no stick to this pledge”, suppliers
representing 53% of the company’s $76bn direct materialannual purchase value last year have already signed on.The company has 18,940 suppliers.
This success he puts down to “education and outreach”
over the past couple of years, but details to “shape thispledge” were worked on with a focus group of 11 suppliersin the third quarter of last year, before a more formaldocument was sent to all suppliers in April.
Certainly, GM has been putting in the effort with its
suppliers. According to the 
2021 Plante Moran Working
Relations Index [see chart below] which measures supplierrelationships in the auto industry, GM saw a 20 pointimprovement last year and is now ranked third in NorthAmerica behind Toyota and Honda.10/25/22  12 57 PM How GM s sett ng the pace for Scope 3 reduct ons  Cap ta  Mon tor

Glencore itself is no stranger to ESG controversy. On 24
May, the company agreed to court payments in the US, UKand Brazil of more than $1bn to 
settle long-term
investigations of bribery and market manipulation.
Gersdorff’s approach is conciliatory. Rather than
criticising any individual sector, he again emphasises thatGM is not forcing its pledge on suppliers and says thatharder-to-abate industries needed “understanding”.
He spoke to 
Capital Monitor  on the sidelines of a mining
conference in Oxford, UK, and said that his role was to
have “side conversations and meetings” with miningcompanies and their executives to articulate GM’sposition.
“It starts with having that relationship and then seeing
what we can do together to get them on board,” he says.
Ethical pillars
As well as asking suppliers to limit Scope 1 and 2emissions, part of the pledge is also to have a minimumscore of 50 in the EcoVadis Labor & Human Rights, Ethicsand Sustainable Procurement pillars by 2025.
Bettina Grabmayr, methodology and institutional relations
director for EcoVadis in Brussels, describes the GMinitiative as “a really good example” of what such a pledgeshould look like.10/25/22  12 57 PM How GM s sett ng the pace for Scope 3 reduct ons  Cap ta  Mon tor
Page 11 of 13 https //cap ta mon tor a /sector/consumer/scope 3 gm dr v ng pace/To reach a score of 50, she explains, companies should
have “a good [methodological] skeleton in place” and aformalised reporting system that covers policies, actionsand results across all their sustainability issues – resultsthat EcoVadis will track and to which both GM andsuppliers will have access.
Although reaching these targets will require what
Gersdorff admits is “substantial” work – he estimates thatthe supplier average score is around 44 – Grabmayr is yetto see any pushback from suppliers.   
“Companies which really see the value, understand that
this could be a competitive advantage for them,” she says.
Industry dinosaur
Gersdorff acknowledges that the pledge is not altruistic.Any supplier improvement helps its own targets. He saysthat 14% of the company’s Scope 3 emissions arecurrently related to purchased goods and services andthat “as our suppliers reduce their carbon emissions, itwill impact our Scope 3 emissions”.
It’s unclear whether GM’s Scope 3 efforts are being
recognised by investors, however. In a detailed case studyat the end of last year investment manager FederatedHermes ($669bn AUM at the end of 2021) described GM’spivot towards ESG as “underappreciated” by investorswho still categorised the company as an “industrydinosaur”.10/25/22  12 57 PM How GM s sett ng the pace for Scope 3 reduct ons  Cap ta  Mon tor

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, profoundly affecting all regions of the world and all sectors of society. Without mitigation or
adaptation, climate effects such as warming, flooding, drought, extreme weather events and rising sea levels are projected to reduce agricultural yields, forcepeople from their homes, endanger livelihoods and destroy infrastructure in the coming decades.
To avoid the worst effects of climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has called for the world to reduce global greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions to net zero by 2050. Achieving this moonshot goal requires immediate action from all parMs of society, including business. Companies need tobe parM of the solution to manage physical and transition risk, maintain societal license to operate and create value for business and society through mitigationand adaptation initiatives that draw on unique business capabilities.
As a large omni-channel retailer with millions of customers worldwide and a global sourcing footprint, WalmarM is able to lead by reducing emissions in our
operations and supply chain while galvanizing collective action across our industry. We believe a strong climate action strategy will help us manage the physicaland transition risks associated with climate change, strengthening the resilience of our business and helping us create value for stakeholders.
WalmarM’s Approach
We seek to lead on climate action. We focus on achieving our science-based targets for emissions reduction in our global operations and supply chain in ways thatstrengthen the perjormance and resilience of our business. We also advocate for and supporM initiatives to accelerate progress toward net zero by 2050 acrossthe industry, and society more broadly, by drawing on our capabilities as an international retailer — our ability to engage suppliers across many categories, ourretail and supply chain experMise, our digital capabilities, our leadership role in industry and multi-stakeholder coalitions and forums and strategic philanthropythrough WalmarM.org. Our efforMs include:
Governing our climate strategy through accountable leadership and assessing climate risk;
Mitigating emissions through approved science-based targets, covering both our global operations (aiming for zero emissions by 2040) and suppliers(through Project Gigaton );
Adapting our business (e.g., facilities and sourcing) to be more resilient in the face of climate risk;
Advocating for 1.5º-C-aligned public policy through direct advocacy, engagement with trade associations and consorMia, and corporate communication; and
ReporMing on our progress with transparency, verifiable data, and science-based methodologies, and encouraging our suppliers to set ambitious targets andreporM on their progress with equivalent diligence.

Climate strategy is a key parM of WalmarM’s Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) strategy. WalmarM’s corporate sustainability team leads the development
of the company’s climate strategy, working with a cross-functional team including finance, real estate, operations, merchandising, strategy, and public policy. Ourclimate strategy is reviewed at least annually by the WalmarM executive leadership team.
The company assesses climate risk annually as parM of our Enterprise Risk Management process. Periodically, we conduct an in-depth, scenario-based climate risk
assessment (first completed in 2017; updated in 2020). Merchants and operators have goals that supporM our climate mitigation and adaptation strategies,including emissions reduction initiatives.
Board Oversight
The 
Nominating and Governance Committee (NGC) of the Board of Directors oversees WalmarM's climate strategy. In 2021, the NGC and management discussed
WalmarM's climate risk assessment; integration of climate mitigation and adaptation into the company's long-range plans, annual operating plans and Enterprise
Risk Management; WalmarM's climate policy positions, advocacy strategy and external engagement; and climate disclosure strategies.

To inform the company’s climate mitigation and adaptation strategies, WalmarM periodically conducts a scenario-based climate risk assessment, aiming to align
with the scenario guidance set forMh by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). We updated the physical risk analysis in 2020 with thehelp of a third-parMy consultant, considering climate-related risks in the shorM-, medium- and long-term.
Methodology & Findings
To assess physical risk, we used Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, a GHG concentration scenario adopted by the United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that assumes the absence of furMher decarbonization on the planet (and is therefore an indicator of theinherent/unmitigated risk of climate change). We analyzed the impact of five associated climate effects — flood (riverine and coastal), heat, drought, extremeprecipitation, and extreme winds — across five key geographies (Canada, China, India, Mexico, and the United States) for 2030 and 2050. We evaluated directimpacts of climate change on WalmarM’s physical assets (retail stores and retail-related facilities), supply chain, and communities.Such climate risks and potential impacts are not unique to WalmarM; they will affect food and general merchandise retailers as well as other businesses andcommunities around the world. While the limitations of the analysis  mean it cannot be used to predict the net impact on WalmarM’s financial results ofoperations or business operations, and the improbable nature of the RCP 8.5 scenario mean it cannot be used to determine the materiality of climate-relatedrisks and opporMunities to the business, it neverMheless provides helpful insights into the relative impact of various climate effects and the relevance of WalmarM’smitigation and adaptation strategies. And while no single climate risk appears to be consequential for WalmarM due to the long-term nature of the risks andWalmarM’s relatively large scale, taken together, they paint a sobering picture of potential impact to people and the planet and underscore the need forimmediate business action to help prevent the worst effects of climate change.
Insights provided by the climate risk assessment help us set long-term strategy and drive innovation. Leaders from across the company, including merchandising,
real estate, operations, and supply chain, discussed the results of the physical risk assessment and incorporated findings into their operating plans.Scope of Analysis

The climate risk assessment identified potential variables that could affect WalmarM’s facilities over the next three decades: flooding and extreme storms, with
potential damage to buildings and inventory; and temperature changes, which the modeling suggests could increase heating and cooling costs in two-thirds ofWalmarM locations by 2030 and 80% of locations by 2050 — underscoring the relevance of WalmarM clean energy initiatives and other mitigation and adaptationefforMs.
Changes to historical location heating and cooling costs —predicted for 2050
Supply Chain
By 2050, climate change is likely to affect the production, distribution and (in some cases) the viability of food and other consumer products that depend onagriculture. We analyzed the potential climate exposure of 25 commodities. For the 11 goods that face the highest overall impact from climate change, weassessed three factors: land suitability, farming conditions for animal products and heat stress for people. The analysis suggested that some commodities (e.g.,coffee, cocoa and cotton) may face significant challenges due to future climate effects, while others (e.g., avocados, animal feed, milk, oranges and rice) mayremain largely unaffected. Our merchants and global sourcing teams are working with suppliers to implement more sustainable practices that promote resilience,such as cultivating heat resistant crops to prevent future sourcing challenges. The analysis underscores the relevance of WalmarM sustainable commodityinitiatives and other initiatives focused on enhancing the resilience of supply chains.
Communities
We modeled the potential impact of several climate variables on WalmarM U.S. store communities: flooding (from either coastal or riverine sources), extremewind (e.g., hurricanes) and heat. Our analysis suggests that ~50% of communities currently served by WalmarM U.S. facilities may face significant, long-termdisruption by 2050. If these areas become less habitable, people could be forced to relocate — creating challenges to physical, financial, and emotional well-being10

deteriorate due to the loss of jobs and homes after a hurricane, and in some vulnerable U.S. counties, there could be an up to 230% increase in household powercosts.
A 
New York Times analysis found that summer temperatures in cities such as Dallas, Miami and New York can be warmer in poorer neighborhoods than in wealthier
ones, where populations are generally whiter. Our own analysis also suggests that climate change has the potential to disproporMionately impact vulnerable
populations, including communities of color. We continue to advocate for climate solutions that advance equity. For example, in Florida, we worked with utilitycompanies, advocates and regulators to help negotiate the largest shared solar program in the country, which authorizes nearly 40 megawatts of clean energyfor low-income Floridians.
Additional Transition Risks Considered
Regulation (current and emerging) 
Examples
Changes to carbon pricing regimes (e.g., RGGI, CA AB 32, WCI and country level carbon taxes)
State and federal level energy targets and requirements (e.g., Renewable PorMfolio Standard (RPS), clean energy standards)
Changes to HFC refrigerant regulations (e.g., Kigali Agreement, U.S. American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, California Air Resources Board
HFC Reduction Measures Act, E.U. F-Gas)
Policy targets, fuel and engine standards, subsidies and incentives associated with increasing usage of zero emissions vehicles and infrastructure (CAACT rule, Interstate ZEV MOU, federal vehicle emissions standards)
Changes to energy and water efficiency standards for buildings and equipment
Changes to subsidies and incentives related to demand-side energy management and renewable energy generation (e.g., U.S. ITC, CPUC Net EnergyMetering 3.0 proceeding, PTC, feed-in-tariffs)
Introduction of product taxes, labeling regulations, and design standards for carbon- or water-intensive product categories (e.g., meat, dairy, nuts,produce, appliances)
Approaches to Managing Risk
Policy monitoring and modeling, integration into business and financial planning
Engagement in stakeholder forums associated with regulatory processes and rulemaking
Advocacy on climate policy proposals and creation of policy principles to assess and endorse position statements developed by external parMners
Emissions reduction initiatives; energy efficiency, renewables, phasing out of HFC refrigerants, transitioning to zero emission vehicles, ProjectGigaton
Technology
Examples
Advances in fossil-fuel mining and petroleum production that keep fossil-fuel prices low, thereby adversely affecting the economics of emission
reduction initiatives
Changes in low-carbon technology and manufacturing that cause existing assets to decrease in value, competitiveness or become absolute (e.g.,onsite EV chargers become underutilized if hydrogen becomes dominant for passenger vehicles)
Advances in low-carbon and renewable generation and manufacturing that bring down the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) making existing long-termpower purchase agreements less valuable in comparison (e.g., older generation wind farms)
Approaches to Managing Risk
Monitoring technology trends and forecast scenarios
Building flexibility into infrastructure changes
Leasing assets rather than investing directly
Advocating for technology-neutral emission reduction policies

To achieve zero emissions across our global operations (Scopes 1 & 2) by 2040; and
Our goal to help reduce or avoid one billion metric tons (a gigaton) of greenhouse gases in the global value chain (Scope 3) by 2030.
Emissions From Our Global Operations (Scopes 1 & 2)
In 2020, we raised our aspiration to reduce emissions in our operations (Scopes 1 & 2) by realigning our science-based target to a 1.5-degree Celsius trajectory,Patchwork of disparate city or state level regulations (e.g., energy regulations) rather than consistent national regulations, making compliance more

interim goal of reducing absolute Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 35% by 2025 and by 65% by 2030 from our 2015 base year. We were the first U.S. retailer tomake a 
zero emissions commitment that does not rely on carbon offsets. We achieved a 23.2% reduction in combined Scopes 1 and 2 emissions between our 2015
calendar year baseline and 2021.
While Scope 2 emissions in 2021 declined by 19% over 2020, 2021 Scope 1 emissions increased by approximately 9%.  The primary driver of the increase in Scope 1
emissions was increases in onsite refrigerants. Our plans to address these factors are addressed below.
Despite the continued rise in Scope 1 emissions, momentum in Scope 2 reductions has meant that, through CY2021, our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions
reduction has tracked the downward trajectory of our science-based target. This may not be the case each year, as the pace and scope of our investments inemissions reduction and realized reductions are not linear. To continue to move toward our science-based target, we continue to work towards reducing ouremissions through five primary workstreams:
Renewable energy
Energy efficiency
Refrigeration
TransporMation
Stationary fuels
While the relative contribution of each workstream toward emissions reduction will vary over time based on operational, financial, and technologicalconsiderations, they all matter for us to achieve our zero-emissions ambition and interim targets.

Electricity is the biggest contributor to our operational emissions, accounting for nearly 100% of our Scope 2 emissions and approximately 47% of our overall
operational emissions in 2021. To achieve our overall goal of zero emissions across global operations by 2040, we aspire to power 50% of our global operationswith renewable sources of energy by 2025 and 100% by 2035. In 2021, an estimated 46% of our global electricity needs were supplied by renewable sources.WalmarM directly procured an estimated 28% of our global electricity needs through Renewable Energy contracts in 2021.
We make progress through a combination of onsite generation and power purchase agreements:
As of the end of 2021, we had more than 600 onsite and offsite renewable energy projects in operation or under development in over 10
countries.   According to the U.S. EPA Green Power ParMnership Top 30 Retail Ranking, WalmarM was the top retail parMner in terms of annual green power
usage in the U.S. as of July 2022.  
In 2021, we contracted to purchase additional renewable energy, including 50 MW of a 129 MW community solar project in New York that will supplyrenewable energy to 36 facilities.  
We also parMicipate in and supporM coalitions like the 
Clean Energy Buyers Association (formerly REBA),  RE100, and others to help shape energy policies and
advance cost-effective sustainable options in the regions where we operate.
WalmarM’s Inaugural Green Bond and Green Financing Framework
In September 2021, WalmarM issued a $2 billion, 10-year green bond, the first under our Green Financing Framework. The Framework outlines the types of
sustainable financing WalmarM can issue and the uses to which proceeds may be put with eligible spend categories including renewable energy, high-perjormance buildings, sustainable transporM, zero waste and circular economy, water stewardship and habitat restoration and conservation.
When published, reporMing on the allocation and impact of bond proceeds can be found on our 
Investor Relations site for ESG Investors.
Energy Efficiency
Our energy efficiency strategy includes both new facility design and construction and retrofitting existing facilities:
We are incorporating efficiency into new store designs in lighting, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), refrigeration, and other categories such
as plug loads.  
As our existing buildings and equipment age, we aim to replace or upgrade older equipment with the latest in high-efficiency technology.  
We use technology to monitor and optimize energy use in our buildings, and have installed energy meters at thousands of our facilities around the world.This allows energy managers to monitor energy consumption in almost real time at our retail stores and distribution centers. This data is used in severalways, including compiling monthly store reporMs, triggering variance alarms, diagnosing equipment problems and validating perjormance of new equipmenttests. 
TransporMation
Our fleet (transporM fuel and mobile refrigerants) contributed approximately 21% of our Scope 1 emissions (and approximately 11% of our overall operationalemissions) in 2021. Electrifying our fleet and reaching net-zero emissions from all our vehicles and transporMation network, including long-haul trucks in the U.S.and Canada, is a key priority for reaching our zero-emissions target.
We use four strategies to accelerate this work:
Enhancing Our Fleet: Between 2005 and 2015, we improved our truck fleet efficiency—almost doubling it in 10 years—in collaboration with equipment
manufacturers, policymakers, utilities, transporMation working groups and other organizations. While efficiency remains a focus, we are now working within ourfleet to evaluate potential solutions to help us substantially reduce our emissions, including testing heavy-duty zero-emission vehicles, battery electric vehiclesand hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. We test cerMain new technologies through conversion to low-carbon fuels and technologies—such as transitioning diesel-operated forklifts to electric ones. These conversions are facilitated by Low Carbon Fuel Standard credit programs, such as those in California and Oregon, whichprovide a financial benefit for transitioning equipment.
Last Mile: As much as possible, we are seeking to electrify our last-mile offerings to customers. WalmarM U.S. announced plans to purchase 1,100 Ford E-Transit
electric vans in 2022 and has reserved 5,000 BrightDrop electric delivery vans, which will hit the road as early as 2023. WalmarM also

growing last-mile delivery fleet. In India, our FlipkarM business joined the EV100 initiative and committed to using electric vehicles for delivery by 2030.
Class 8 Heavy-Duty Truck Innovations: Currently, there is no scalable solution to decarbonize long-haul/heavy-duty Class 8 tractors. We believe multiple
technologies could play a role in the future, including renewable diesel, electric battery and hydrogen fuels. We supporM the development of these technologiesby parMicipating in feasibility testing and providing feedback to manufacturers to ensure vehicle technology meets the needs of WalmarM’s fleet and other largefleets. For example:
WalmarM Canada announced that it has reserved 130 Tesla Semi trucks, electric trucks that are designed to use less than two kilowatt-hours of energy per
mile at Gross Vehicle Weight and highway speed.    
We are currently using seven electric yard trucks with a plan to increase the number of electric yard trucks in operation by the end of 2022. Currently, ourelectric yard trucks provide approximately 50% emissions reduction compared to diesel trucks.  
In 2023, WalmarM plans to test several electric and hydrogen fuel powered Class 8 vehicles in its operation.  
Public Policy: WalmarM supporMs public policy that will create an enabling environment for the development, adoption and scaling of zero-emission commercialtransporMation fleets. Collaborating with PepsiCo, WalmarM released a set of 
public policy principles to convey to federal and state policymakers the types of
policy interventions, planning and guidance that can supporM this transition. These principles reflect our business strategy, promote efficiency and optimization asa reduction pathway and take a technology-neutral approach so that we can align our distribution network outcomes with environmental and communitybenefits.
Read more about how we are working to reduce emissions in our transporMation network.
Stationary Fuels
Stationary fuels, including fossil fuels used for heating, cooling and backup power, contributed approximately 20% of our Scope 1 emissions (and approximately11% of our overall operational emissions) in 2021. A key parM of our decarbonization strategy is to reduce our dependence on these fuels by increasing efficiency,transitioning to cleaner fuels, and electrifying equipment. For example, at our U.S. stores we have added electrical connection points to power units (such as ourrefrigerated trailers), which provide temporary storage capacity during peak seasons.
Onsite Refrigerants
Onsite refrigerant emissions contributed approximately 58% of our Scope 1 emissions (and 31% of our overall operational emissions) in 2021. Global Scope 1 onsiterefrigerant emissions increased 17% from 2020 to 2021. Our analysis suggests that the continued increase in our onsite refrigerant emissions remains primarilydue to ongoing maintenance of refrigeration equipment using R-404A, a widely used refrigerant introduced in the mid-1990s as a replacement for ozone-depleting refrigerants.  As our equipment ages and is retired from service, we are replacing it with lower Global Warming Potential (GWP) alternatives. Weanticipate a continued rise in onsite refrigerant emissions in the near term until this equipment is converMed.
We are addressing these emissions in three ways:Managing Leaks: We continue working to minimize refrigerant gas leakage through repairing and maintaining our existing equipment, as well as by working with
industry-leading consultants to implement innovative solutions for reuse. Such efforMs have resulted in an average leak rate across our U.S. store operations thatis lower than the supermarket industry average stated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Implementing Low-GWP Systems: We operate more than 100 facilities (stores and distribution centers) using ultra-low GWP refrigerants including carbon
dioxide (CO ), glycol and ammonia. These systems are used in new construction where commercially available. For example, in November 2021, we opened astore in Yaphank, New York that is the first to fully utilize CO  technology for the store’s refrigeration needs. Most systems across our U.S. retail footprint,however, currently utilize high-GWP refrigerants. Those systems still need to be converMed to low-GWP systems to reach our zero emissions target. Our ongoingstrategy is to replace these systems as they reach their end-of-life, balancing the investment and replacement schedule with our zero-emissions commitments.
Advocacy to SupporZ Scaled Adoption of Low-GWP Technology: WalmarM supporMs federal policy that would require the phasing out of high-GWP refrigerants, as
that would supporM market changes necessary to implement low-GWP systems at scale and at reasonable cost. WalmarM joined members of the Air-Conditioning,Heating, and Refrigeration Institute in endorsing a petition to the EPA regarding the adoption of rules to prohibit the use of refrigerants with high GWP. WalmarMalso submitted a letter to the EPA supporMing regulatory actions for stationary refrigeration equipment that are environmentally effective (e.g., limiting newcommercial systems with charges over 50 lbs. to use refrigerants with a GWP of 150 or less) and nationally consistent.
Supply Chain (Scope 3)WalmarM’s 
science-based target includes Project Gigaton , an ambitious efforM to engage suppliers, NGOs and other stakeholders in climate action with a goal
to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons (a gigaton) of greenhouse gas emissions in the global value chain by 2030. Aligned with the Paris Agreement’s original
2-degree Celsius warming scenario and designed in consultation with World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) and CDP, ProjectGigaton's  success would represent a substantial reduction of Scope 3 emissions within WalmarM’s and our suppliers’ value chains.

Project Gigaton  and WalmarM's Scope 3 Footprint
Achieving the Project Gigaton  goal of reducing or avoiding 1 billion metric tons of CO e emissions by 2030 would represent a substantial, Paris-aligned
reduction of Scope 3 emissions from WalmarM’s and our suppliers’ value chains.
For a retailer like WalmarM, Scope 3 emissions include multiple upstream and downstream categories, including purchased goods and services and use of sold
products. Examples include the emissions associated with washing and drying an arMicle of clothing over its lifetime or emissions from growing, harvesting,transporMing, eating and disposing of fresh produce. Many factors impact an item’s footprint and there are no precise ways to measure these emissions, soestimates must be employed.
WalmarM’s objective in creating Project Gigaton  was to starM the consumer goods industry on the path toward decarbonization by spurring immediate, concrete
action to avoid or reduce upstream and downstream emissions. Methods used today to calculate Scope 3 emissions did not exist at the time; to set an ambitiousand science-based target, 
we began with an estimate that approximately 95% of a retailer’s emissions were in Scope 3. Using WalmarM’s 2015 Scopes 1 and 2
emissions as a baseline (originally reporMed to CDP as 21.04 MMT CO e), we assumed that our 2015 Scope 3 emissions were approximately 400 million metrictons CO e.  A Paris-aligned reduction of 2.5% per year would represent a cumulative reduction of approximately 1 billion metric tons (one gigaton) of emissionsover the life of the initiative.
The Science-Based Targets initiative approved Project Gigaton  as parM of WalmarM’s original science-based target in 2016. We then worked with CDP, WWF, and
EDF to design a methodology to capture the real-world emissions avoidance and reduction impacts of supplier action, which is set forMh in the 
Project Gigaton
Accounting Methodology. Project Gigaton  was officially launched in 2017.
We remain focused on the success of Project Gigaton  and driving real, measurable progress with our suppliers as parM of our ambition to play a leading role in
helping the world achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
With respect to WalmarM’s own supply chain and Scope 3 footprint, WalmarM has been reporMing estimated Scope 3 emissions in its two largest categories — (1)
purchased goods and services and (2) use of sold products — using CDP-approved methodologies and reporMing them through CDP. For 2020, we reporMed thatour estimated emissions for these categories for WalmarM U.S. were 130.2 and 32.2  MMT CO e, respectively.
In 2022, we are reassessing our overall Scope 3 footprint, action plan, measurement methodologies, and disclosures.
Project Gigaton  Results
We work with suppliers through Project Gigaton  to set targets and take science-based, measurable action in six arenas critical to decarbonizing value chains.
Since launch, more than 4,500 suppliers have signed up, making Project Gigaton  one of the largest private sector consorMia of its kind. Suppliers are invitedannually to reporM through Project Gigaton  and choose whether to reporM, as furMher set out in the 
Project Gigaton TM Accounting Methodology. During the

Page 12 of 21 https //corporate wa mart com/esgreport/env ronmenta /c mate changeSupplier Engagement Through Project Gigaton
Project Gigaton  is designed to catalyze real, measurable impact in product supply chains. It works in the following ways:
Democratizing Climate Action: The Project Gigaton  platform is designed to accommodate suppliers who vary in their readiness and capability of underMaking
intensive GHG reduction efforMs. The platform offers resources such as guidance on goal-setting, workshops on best practices and playbooks and otherdocuments that help companies get starMed. In 2021, suppliers reporMing to Project Gigaton  ranged in size from $1 million to $14 billion in U.S. product net sales.
Driving Decarbonization of the Most Critical ParZs of the Supply Chain: The platform encourages suppliers to take action across the six areas that are the most
critical in reaching zero emissions and most relevant to our suppliers’ businesses: energy use, nature, waste, packaging, transporMation and product use anddesign.
Providing Access to Science-Based Resources: Project Gigaton  includes useful tools including calculators, playbooks and programs to guide action and inspire
innovation. For example, suppliers can answer a series of questions about packaging changes, and our calculators will help them determine the emission factorused, enable them to reporM accurate information for Project Gigaton  and provide data to spark ideas for additional improvements. We also host 
workshops for
suppliers with coaching from NGOs on how to best use the calculators to furMher their efforMs, co-created a collaborative Power Purchase Agreement open only
to WalmarM suppliers, and worked with CDP and HSBC to provide an early-payment program for suppliers who set science-based targets or have achieved cerMain
score thresholds from CDP.
Ratcheting Ambition: The program is designed to promote increased ambition over time through recognition. Suppliers can sign up, starM setting goals, take
action, strive to achieve Sparking Change status and then strive to achieve Giga Guru status:
Sparking Change: Suppliers that have set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-limited) goals, agreed to share them publicly andreporMed reducing or avoiding emissions in the most recent reporMing year. In 2021, more than 750 suppliers were recognized for Sparking Change. 
Giga Gurus: Suppliers that have set SMART goals in three pillars, agreed to share them publicly and reporMed reducing or avoiding emissions in three pillarsduring the most recent reporMing year. To keep the level of ambition high, we increased the requirements to qualify for Giga Guru status in 2021 fromsetting goals and reporMing in one pillar to setting goals and reporMing in three pillars. In the 2021 reporMing year, we recognized more than 1,000 suppliersas Giga Gurus.  
WalmarM 
publicly recognizes suppliers achieving these milestones to thank them for their efforMs and to inspire others to join and increase their ambition.

Action Area Actions We Encourage Suppliers to Take Example WalmarZ SupporZ
Energy Avoid energy-related emissions in two ways: 1) reduce energy demand
through optimization and efficiency and 2) transition to energy sourcesthat are renewable and emit little to no carbon.Energy procurement is often a key source of a business’ greenhouse gas emissions. We provideresources for suppliers to reduce energy demand through optimization and efficiency andtransition to renewable energy sources.
WalmarM launched the Gigaton PPA (GPPA) in 2020, an initiative to accelerate renewableenergy adoption by offering suppliers the opporMunity to parMicipate in aggregate, utility-scale power purchase agreements (PPA)s. In 2021, the first Gigaton PPA cohorM was formedand the project is progressing through the development process. Since 2021, the programhas educated more than 100 WalmarM suppliers on renewable energy topics. In late 2021,WalmarM began engaging suppliers to form the second Gigaton PPA cohorM.
WalmarM has  to help companies get starMed on both energy efficiency and renewable energyprocurement, including the DeparMment of Energy’s Better Buildings Alliance and the CleanEnergy Buyers Association.  
WalmarM developed a Factory Energy Efficiency tool to assist factories in becoming moreenergy efficient, tracking energy use and reductions and converMing those savings to GHGreductions; over 900 factories have signed up for this tool to date.

TransporZation Improve fleet efficiencies, optimize routes and introduce zero-emissionvehicles to avoid carbon emissions in the supply chain.Fossil-fuel powered vehicles produce greenhouse gas emissions during their operation and aretypically a major source of value chain emissions. While WalmarM has long provided references tothird-parMy sources to help suppliers optimize efficiency through its energy pillar, WalmarMintroduced the transporMation pillar in 2021 focusing on fleet efficiency, including reduced milesand zero-emission vehicles.
Product Use &DesignDesign products to reduce emissions throughout the product lifecycle,from use of raw materials in manufacturing the product (e.g.,incorporating recycled content) through consumer use (e.g., LEDlightbulbs).Product use and design impacts several key scope 3 categories, including use of sold products andend-of-life treatment of sold products.

Adaptation
Our climate strategy includes adapting our operations and sourcing to enhance resilience. Examples include:
Disaster Resilience
WalmarM’s Emergency Management DeparMment uses predictive analytics to gauge the path and likely severity of seasonal weather events that can impact
operations and supply lines. The Emergency Management team helps our operations and supply chain teams prepare for and mitigate the effects of such events.If disaster strikes, the Emergency Management team operates out of WalmarM’s Emergency Operations Center, engaging associates, local governments, NGOsand others as needed. The team deploys associates with specialized experMise as well as mobile generators, fuel resources, trucks and other resources to managecrises on the ground. Storms impacting larger geographies, such as the February 2021 winter storm across the southern U.S., contributed to this trend.
WalmarM and the WalmarM Foundation also work to build capacity for preparedness and response in vulnerable communities through engagement of stakeholders,
best practice sharing and philanthropic investments. For example, in FY2022 the WalmarM Foundation granted $3 million to build capacity in underrepresentedand vulnerable communities to help them prepare and mitigate against the impact of disasters, including to BIPOC-led organizations like the Institute forDiversity and Inclusion in Emergency Management.

When designing facilities in storm-prone locations, we incorporate cerMain precautionary measures to help facilities withstand storms and recover as quickly as
possible with minimal disruption in service. To help sustain access to electrical power when we need it most, we have invested in a fleet of permanent and mobilegenerators to supporM our distribution centers, stores and clubs during hurricanes, wildfires, winter storms and day-to-day power surges. For example, given theprobability of storms impacting stores in the U.S. Gulf Coast and along the eastern seaboard, nearly all stores within a cerMain range of the coast have a generatoror quick connects for mobile generators. Because permanent generators are not financially justifiable at all stores, we take other measures, including stagingmobile generators and refrigerated trailers, to reduce the time it takes to respond to power outages. In 2021, we proactively staged over 1,200 refrigeratedtrailers at over 700 locations ahead of extreme weather events. Additionally, mobile generators kept stores, clubs and distribution centers powered to servecommunities for more than 10,000 hours while grid electricity was not available. These measures not only enable us to serve customers when we would ordinarilyneed to close stores, but also help to reduce food loss by avoiding hours of power loss. As climate-related events increase in frequency and severity, we aim tostay in front of issues by preparing for what lies ahead.TM

We have prioritized incorporating energy efficiency into new store designs and upgrading older equipment where economically feasible with higher-efficiency
technology which will help us adapt to a warming climate. We also use technology to monitor and optimize energy use in our buildings. Energy—including electricand gas—is one of our top operating expenses and optimizing energy use can help us control both expense and emissions. A few degrees of rise or fall in averagetemperature can translate to considerable costs, as HVAC and refrigeration systems must work longer and harder to keep temperatures in stores and productcases at optimal levels.
Sourcing: Surety of Supply
Managing Day-to-Day Disruptions
Our merchants use a variety of tools to manage volatility and surety of supply day-to-day. Our sourcing teams manage food commodity supply risks by building
upstream capacity, diversifying our sourcing regions and exploring new technology and innovation. For example, our merchants use predictive weather data toadjust product deployment and replenishment rates in the shorM term, as well as leverage historical data on sales perjormance and customer buying patterns toinform product assorMment shifts over time. This helps ensure that as the climate changes, we continue to offer the right products for our customers at the righttime.
Country of Origin Strategies
While about two-thirds of what WalmarM U.S. spends on products comes from items made, grown or assembled in the U.S. (according to data from our suppliers),globally sourced items face the risk of climate-related disruption. WalmarM’s Global Sourcing team regularly reviews risks and opporMunities related to the countryof origin of the products they source. The Global Sourcing team works with WalmarM merchants and third-parMy experMs to develop mitigation strategies,including measures to enhance supply chain resilience within countries of origin, as well as diversification of sources of supply.
Transforming Product Supply Chains for Long-Term Sustainability
Because agricultural commodities can be especially susceptible to severe weather events and to climate change, WalmarM has prioritized strategic initiatives toenhance commodity supply chain sustainability and resilience. WalmarM’s efforMs include setting sourcing requirements and product specifications for suppliers,engaging suppliers in measurement and best practice sharing, supporMing industry collaboration, engaging our customers, public policy advocacy, andphilanthropy.

Product Supply Chains: Sustainability Overview
Managing Transition Risks
Transitioning to a net-zero economy will bring about regulatory, technological, legal, market and reputational changes that will likely impact companies, including
ours. (See Climate Risk Assessment above.) We evaluate these risks as parM of the company’s annual Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process that considers
strategic, operational, reputational, financial, and regulatory and compliance risks. The assessments include mitigation plans against critical risks, and ongoing ornew issues are addressed through the strategic planning process. The results of these assessments are shared with WalmarM’s Governance Risk Committee (GRC)and with the Audit Committee of the WalmarM Board of Directors.
In addition to the ERM process, individual business segments and functions also assess climate-related policy issues as parM of developing their annual strategic
and operating plans. For example, regulation often affects costs in our operations and value chain. WalmarM has established policy councils to assess potential newlegislation/regulations and commitments within and across key markets. The policy councils include internal stakeholders from various parMs of the organization(e.g., Government Affairs, Legal, Real Estate, Communications, and Compliance).
Another reputational risk comes from customer perception of WalmarM’s climate action, including how we design and run our stores and the products we offer.
Our corporate affairs teams monitor sentiment across customers, investors, associates, and other stakeholders via digital and traditional media engagement andcoverage. Our stakeholders help us understand climate risks and opporMunities so that we can develop more effective solutions.

CDP Response.
Advocacy
We believe a strong climate strategy across government, business and civil society will help everyone manage the physical and transition risks associated with
climate change, contributing to the resilience of our business and the communities we serve. We advocate for climate policy through engagement of policymakers, industry associations and multi-stakeholder coalitions, as well as through corporate communications.
Governance and Transparency
Climate Policy Priorities
WalmarM is committed to policy advocacy aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement. Our advocacy has been consistent with that agreement since 2016. In 2021,10/25/22  1 00 PM C mate Change
Page 16 of 21 https //corporate wa mart com/esgreport/env ronmenta /c mate changewe memorialized our commitment in a Board-approved Statement on Climate Policy. The Statement frames our advocacy around achieving 1.5° Celsius-aligned,
science-based national and international climate policies that are consistent with achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and that equitably address the needs of
all stakeholders.
We believe market-based and economy-wide emissions-reduction policies, like a price on carbon, are critical to achieving ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions while supporMing economic prosperity. We also recognize that market-based, technology-neutral approaches for hard-to-decarbonize sectors can playa valuable role in the absence of economy-wide action.
Climate Policy Oversight
By charMer, the Nominating and Governance Committee (NGC) of the WalmarM Inc. Board of Directors — a Board committee comprised of independent
directors — oversees our public policy strategies and activities, including those related to climate change. Management provides regular updates at least annuallyto the NGC concerning the company’s public policy strategy and highlights of the committee’s discussions with management are shared with the full Board ofDirectors. In 2021, NGC/management discussions included WalmarM’s planned U.S. federal government affairs and policy priorities for 2021-2022 and a review of2020-2021 activities, including engagement with and through key trade associations on climate change and other priority topics.
WalmarM’s 
Government Relations Policy (updated in 2022) governs the company’s interaction with elected officials and legislative and regulatory bodies at all
levels. As relevant to climate advocacy, the policy:
Delineates roles and responsibilities with regard to interactions with public officials and legislative bodies;
Sets parameters on the use of funds for political purposes;
Defines the criteria for evaluation of trade association memberships in light of their policy positions and/or political advocacy;
Commits the company to annual discussions between management and the NGC; and
Commits WalmarM to annual reporMing on policy priorities, strategies, activities, and trade association memberships.
Transparency
WalmarM is committed to transparency regarding public policy activities, including climate advocacy. Our disclosures include:
QuarMerly reporMing on lobbying activities and expenditures, which include climate advocacy. 
Discussions regarding our public policy priorities, advocacy strategy and engagements in our ESG reporMing (since 2013).  
State and federal lobbying information on our Investor Relations website (since 2015). 
Our philosophy on trade association memberships and approach to dealing with trade association policy misalignments (see below and our Engagement in
public policy ESG brief). 
A list of trade associations to which WalmarM Inc. contributes funds in an amount of $25,000 or more; we will update this list at least annually.

Direct Engagement of Policy Makers
WalmarM directly engages U.S. policy makers on climate-related policy in line with our Statement on Climate Policy. We employ federal and state registered
lobbyists and registered lobbyist consultants and engage in lobbying contacts as defined under the U.S. Lobbying Disclosure Act (LDA). Our quarMerly reporMs to
Congress include lobbying expenditures, the specific legislative items and public policy issues that were the topics of communication and the registered lobbyistwho lobbied on behalf of the company. Review of WalmarM’s reporMs discloses direct advocacy on climate and other environmental-related topics.
Recent examples of our direct public policy advocacy on major climate policy debates at the federal level in the U.S. include:
Actively advocating, including meeting with key lawmakers, in supporM of the climate provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and assisting our key
trade associations to develop constructive positions on these climate provisions.
Engaging lawmakers to supporM the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which our major trade associations also supporMed, and which includes federalinvestments in the energy and transporMation sectors and to supporM climate resilience.  
Speaking out publicly and engaging lawmakers directly to emphasize the imporMance and urgency of the climate provisions in the Build Back Betterlegislation, as well as conveying supporM for carbon pricing and sector-based, technology-neutral approaches to decarbonize sectors like agriculture. 
Recognizing biparMisan action on climate and submitting a letter of supporM to the U.S. Senate regarding the passage of the Growing Climate Solutions Act,which provides technical resources to farmers and ranchers to invest in nature-based climate solutions.    
Joining members of the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute in endorsing a petition to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)regarding the adoption of national rules to prohibit the use of refrigerants with high global warming potential. We believe this will create a valuable nationalapproach to phasing out the most harmful refrigerants in an expeditious fashion. WalmarM also submitted a letter to the EPA supporMing regulatory actionsfor stationary refrigeration equipment that are environmentally effective (e.g., limiting the use of refrigerants in new commercial systems with chargesover 50 lbs. to those using refrigerants with a GWP of 150 or less) and nationally consistent. 
Collaborating with PepsiCo to release a set of public policy principles to convey to federal and state policymakers the types of policy interventions,

Page 17 of 21 https //corporate wa mart com/esgreport/env ronmenta /c mate changedistribution network outcomes with environmental and community benefits.   
WalmarM has also advocated for Paris-aligned climate policy on the global stage. For example, prior to COP26, we joined key public-private sector initiatives led
by U.S. Special Envoy on Climate John Kerry. The first, Glasgow is Our Business, showcased strong CEO-level sector supporM for a successful COP26 agreement.
The second, the Clean Energy Demand Initiative, works to convey demand and policy signals from large private sector buyers to drive clean energy investment in
crucial global markets. We actively parMicipated in business dialogues during COP26 and represented the official business observer groups in encouraging supporMand action on measures to solidify global carbon market rules and other policy elements in the Glasgow Climate Pact. And WalmarM is active in statehouses acrossthe United States, including joining other businesses to 
advocate for net-zero emissions in Maryland by 2045.
Corporate Communications
Through corporate communications, WalmarM regularly engages the public to make the case for climate action and encourage others to raise their ambitions.
Recent examples include:
Speaking with key climate reporMers
Authoring blogs, op-eds and arMicles advocating for climate policy 
Sharing climate stories, arMicles and milestones via social media  
ParMicipating in videos and podcasts 
Engaging in forums such as the New York Times Climate Hub at COP 26, Greenbiz’s Verge Net Zero conference, ForMune’s Global Sustainability Forum, the
WSJ Pro Sustainability Forum and the Financial Times’ Moral Money Summit: America’s Edition.
Engagement Through Trade Associations
Beyond direct advocacy on climate-related policy, WalmarM is also a member of trade associations and coalitions that the company believes can assist us in
achieving our long-term strategic objectives. These organizations and coalitions allow us to work with other companies on issues that impact the retail sector andbeyond.
WalmarM’s Approach to Engaging Trade Associations
WalmarM supporMs trade associations for many reasons, including development and sharing of best practices on matters imporMant to the industry, advocacy onbehalf of industry interests, promotion of public policy and/or general supporM for an organization’s mission. WalmarM’s engagement model depends on the rolethe trade association plays in helping WalmarM achieve its strategic objectives, and may include varying levels of financial supporM, involvement at the boardand/or with key committees or targeted financial supporM for key initiatives within a broader organization.
As WalmarM transforms its business and trade associations reevaluate their priorities, misalignments may occur. Where they do, we directly engage our trade
associations to help them understand our priorities and positions. We also periodically reevaluate our memberships and engagement models to ensure alignment.
Engagement: We communicate our strategic priorities and perspective on matters of public policy with our trade associations, policymakers and — asappropriate — the public so that our positions are known. For example, we have shared our views on climate policy with key trade associations, the publicand lawmakers (see below).
Membership and Financial SupporZ Reviews: We periodically review our memberships in trade associations and determine if any adjustments are needed inour membership status or the financial supporM we provide to the organization. Where we generally supporM the organization’s priorities and the positionsthe organization has taken on major issues, we may maintain general membership in the organization while working to influence the organization’s directionas necessary. For example, we maintain general membership in the Business Roundtable and work to influence the organization as described elsewhere inthis brief. In other instances, we may elect only to provide financial supporM for parMicular organizational initiatives. For example, we do not pay generalmembership dues to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce but financially supporM cerMain specific U.S. Chamber of Commerce initiatives including the Institutefor Legal Reform, Rule of Law Coalition and Workforce Freedom Initiative. If a relationship — on balance — does not align with our priorities, we would endties with the organization altogether.
Engagement with Major Trade Associations on Climate Policy
We have not identified any material misalignments with our major trade associations with respect to climate policy matters. NeverMheless, in line with the overall
approach described above, we engage trade associations on climate and related policy issues to help them understand our perspective. Examples include:
Business Roundtable: The Business Roundtable advocates for public policy that promotes the U.S. economy and expanded opporMunities for Americans.WalmarM President and CEO Doug McMillon served as Business Roundtable’s Chairman in 2020-2021. We have endorsed Business Roundtable’s call fora
 U.S. national climate policy solution to reduce U.S.-based emissions by at least 80% by 2050 through a market-based mechanism that includes a price on
carbon. WalmarM worked with Business Roundtable on its statement expressing supporM for the climate provisions in Build Back Better and to craft a globalstatement on climate action that was endorsed by business groups in Australia, Canada, the European Union and Mexico. 
National Retail Federation: The National Retail Federation (NRF) is the largest retail trade association in the U.S., representing large and small retailers witha variety of business models. NRF represents the retail industry across a broad range of policy areas including taxes, workforce and sustainability. In January2022, in parMnership with WalmarM and other leading retailers, NRF released the “
Retailers Reaching for Net-zero ” guide, a document developed with the
NRF Sustainability Council (of which WalmarM is a member). The guide makes the business case for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, provides a pathwayfor setting science-based greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and provides an extensive resource list to assist retailers in reaching their ownsustainability goals. In January 2022, WalmarM U.S. President and CEO John Furner 
was elected chairman of the board of NRF. In this capacity he will furMher10/25/22  1 00 PM C mate Change

Retail Industry Leaders Association: The Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA) brings together the nation’s leading retailers to advance the industry
through public policy advocacy and operational excellence and innovation.  In April 2021, RILA released a set of climate priorities that summarize the
member perspective and considerations on greenhouse gas emission reduction strategies and categories that closely intersect with the industry operationsand that receive policy attention at the state and federal level. WalmarM provided insights to RILA to help develop this reporM and supporMed its release. InFebruary 2022, RILA released its Retail 
Climate Action Blueprint, which provides guidance applicable to retail organizations’ climate action strategies.
WalmarM provided feedback on the Blueprint and was quoted in the press release announcing its release. 
International Chamber of Commerce: The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) promotes international trade, responsible business conduct and a
global approach to economic regulation. ICC has been the official Focal Point for Business in the United Nations Framework Convention on ClimateChange (UNFCCC) process since its inception in 1992. At COP26, WalmarM actively engaged and supporMed the Business and Industry NGO group (BINGO)managed by ICC. On behalf of this group, WalmarM delivered a statement to the ParMies during one of the high-level segments, which included languageencouraging action on ArMicle 6 and formalizing rules for global carbon markets. 
Business at OECD: Recognized as the voice of business at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD),  Business at OECD (BIAC)
conveys business perspectives and experMise to policymakers on a range of economic and policy issues. WalmarM is a Vice Chair of the Environment andEnergy Policy Group, which helps OECD guide member governments to design and implement evidence-based policies that address environmentalchallenges and promote green growth. BIAC has provided feedback to the OECD in supporM of international discussions on climate, including the UNFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the G7 and the G20. The group has also provided feedback on how governments can best aligneconomic stimulus measures related to COVID-19 with ambitions on climate change. 
Multi-Stakeholder Coalitions
In addition to working to shape climate strategies and advocacy within the groups discussed above, we are members of other coalitions advocating for an
enabling policy environment, including:
Race to Zero – Retail Campaign: We supporM  the efforM to achieve net zero emissions in the retail sector by 2050. That includes our role as co-lead of the
Retail Race to Zero campaign along with IKEA, H&M, Kingfisher and Best Buy. In FY22, we represented the coalition at COP26 in Glasgow, where wewelcomed several new signatories to the campaign and announced a new 
Accelerator program. 
We Are Still In: We are a  signatory to the coalition, which demonstrates our long-standing commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement. We also signed
the We Mean Business/Ceres letter that supporMs a U.S. goal to cut emissions by at least 50% by 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The group
also endorsed the biparMisan Growing Climate Solutions Act, which reflects a valuable strategy for increasing carbon sequestration opporMunities in theagricultural supply chain. 
Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA): WalmarM is a long-time member of CEBA (formerly REBA), a collaboration of clean energy buyers, energy
providers and service providers that, together with NGO parMners, seek a transition to a zero-carbon energy future. The group advocates for policies suchas wholesale energy market expansion, flexible financing for renewables, retail access and a federal carbon green grid. We advised and endorsed CEBA’sstatement on Build Back Better, which emphasized market and policy-based measures to decarbonize the grid. 
Business for Nature (BFN): We are members of BFN, a global coalition that brings together business and conservation organizations to call forgovernments to adopt policies to reverse nature loss in this decade. In 2020, we supporMed BFN's 
Call to Action to reverse nature loss by 2030. BFN has
been mobilizing members to provide official comment to inform the global biodiversity framework, which is set to be negotiated at the UN COP15 in 2022.We have actively parMicipated in the drafting and 
development of these policy recommendations, have been a strong proponent of language that highlights
that the climate and nature dialogues should be strongly linked and recognize the critical role nature plays in climate mitigation.
LEAF Coalition: WalmarM.org parMicipates in the LEAF Coalition, a coalition bringing together the private sector and governments to provide finance for
tropical and subtropical forest conservation commensurate with the scale of the climate change challenge, to learn along with our peers.

ReporGing
We believe that transparency cultivates trust, helps hold ourselves accountable and – we hope – inspires others to act. We provide an annual update on ourclimate progress here through our ESG ReporMing. 
We also reporM to organizations such as CDP. WalmarM estimates its scopes 1, 2 and parMial scope 3 GHG
emissions in accordance with the  GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and ReporMing Standard and has disclosed this and other climate-related information
annually since 2006. See our third-parMy assurance statement for our CY2021 Scope 1 and 2 emissions verification reporM here.
We encourage suppliers to reporM to CDP and have integrated CDP and Project Gigaton  to make it easier for suppliers to reporM on metrics. We also supporMthe Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and use its reporMing and guidance for climate risk assessment.TM

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, profoundly affecting all regions of the world and all sectors of society. While WalmarM can
play a leading role in its own business, supply chain and beyond, achieving the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) goal of reducing globalgreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to net-zero by 2050 requires action from all parMs of society.
CerMain factors beyond WalmarM’s control impact WalmarM’s ability to achieve its own targets, including changes to local energy grids; our physical presencein geographic areas without available necessary technology, equipment or capabilities; and weather patterns increasing the number of days requiringfacility heating and cooling.
Achieving our targets will require innovation and technology that is not available today, including the evolution and accessibility of refrigeration, electricvehicle (including Class 8, heavy-duty, long-haul tractors), renewable energy, manufacturing and agricultural technologies. A critical mass of potentialconsumers of these new technologies is a necessary precondition to their development, deployment and scaling.
WalmarM is dependent on the cooperation and perjormance of cerMain third parMies, including business parMners providing clean/green services andsuppliers’ capacity and willingness to implement and measure emissions reductions projects.
Public policies may not supporM actions aligned with WalmarM's Science-Based Targets or the ambitions of the Paris Climate agreement, including by notencouraging the development and deployment of low-carbon or low-emissions technologies at scale and public policies that can negatively impact thesupply or cost of renewable energy projects at scale.
WalmarM’s business will continue to evolve and grow. This growth and changes in our model may require additional facilities and/or an expansion of ourfootprint, which may create pressure on our targets.
The capital and operating costs of implementing projects will be a factor (e.g., transitioning to low-GWP refrigerants). Low market prices and volatility ofthe price of fossil fuels can complicate the cost/benefit analyses.
Value chain (scope 3) emissions measurement and reporMing remains an immature field; lack of standardized approaches and comprehensive data sets limitthe ability to generate comparable, reliable and decision-useful information.
National and global catastrophic events, including pandemics, can exacerbate many of the above factors.
Revision History:August 2022: Updated to reflect 2021 GHG emissions and related metrics.
About Our ReporMing
1. In 2020, we raised our aspiration to reduce emissions in our operations (scopes 1 & 2) by realigning
our science-based target to a 1.5 degree Celsius trajectory, the highest ambition approved by theSBTi. Our goal is to achieve zero emissions across WalmarM’s global operations by 2040, reducingabsolute scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions 35% by 2025 and 65% by 2030 from our 2015 base year.
2. Annual scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions and carbon intensity metrics are updated from time to time
in this ESG Climate Brief to account for changes in emission factors or the availability of moreaccurate activity data. FlipkarM emissions data is excluded from WalmarM’s Scope 1 and 2 emissionsfootprint and progress calculation. We believe excluding FlipkarM’s data will have negligible impact onthe overall reporMing.
Our emissions footprint in CO e and carbon intensity per revenue are calculated to include emissions
for our operations for the period which we owned the operations in the reporMing year. This mayresult in updated emissions reporMed in the ESG Climate Brief not corresponding to results reporMedto CDP for our annual Climate Change questionnaire.
We engage Lucideon CICS to independently verify WalmarM’s reporMed scope 1 and scope 2 emissions
as reporMed to CDP annually, pursuant to ISO 14064-3 (the international standard for verification ofGreenhouse Gas inventories). The GHG Protocol outlines three emissions sources (referred to as“scopes”) that provide the framework for operational boundaries. The three scopes are:
Scope 1, “Direct Emissions,” represent emissions from the combustible fuels and other sources thatAdditional Resources
Endnotes
210/25/22  1 00 PM C mate Change
Page 20 of 21 https //corporate wa mart com/esgreport/env ronmenta /c mate changeoccur directly on sites (e.g., refrigerants,) and mobile emissions sources.
Scope 2, “Indirect Emissions,” represent emissions that occur off-site to produce electricity or steam
purchased for use at corporate locations.
Scope 3, “Other Indirect Emissions,” represents emissions from activities down or upstream from a
company’s core business such as product use, waste disposal, commuting, and business travel.
3. Annual scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions are updated from time to time for changes in emission
factors or activity data when more accurate information become available. This may result in updatedemissions reporMed in the ESG Climate Brief that may not correspond to results reporMed to CDP forour annual Climate Change questionnaire. FlipkarM emissions data is excluded from WalmarM’s Scope 1and 2 emissions footprint and progress calculation. We believe excluding FlipkarM’s data will havenegligible impact on the overall reporMing.
We engage Lucideon CICS to independently verify WalmarM’s reporMed scope 1 and scope 2 emissions
as reporMed to CDP annually, pursuant to ISO 14064-3 (the international standard for verification ofGreenhouse Gas inventories). We follow WalmarM’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory Methodology incalculating our GHG emissions, which is consistent with the principles and guidance of the WorldResources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s Greenhouse GasProtocol Initiative (“The GHG Protocol”) for corporate GHG accounting and reporMing. Scope 2(market-based) emissions include the carbon reduction value of renewable electricity procured fromonsite and offsite projects. To account for structural changes in our business, we strive to adjust ouremission reduction progress on scope 1 and 2 emissions to add or subtract emissions for entitiesacquired or divested in the year the acquisition or divestiture took place, including adjusting forprevious years (including the baseline year).
4. Carbon intensity (scope 1 and 2 per revenue) calculation is based on calendar year emissions
(January 1-December 31) and normalized by total annual revenues as measured by WalmarM’s fiscalyear (February 1-January 31).
5. This includes generation from active renewable and low-carbon projects. It considers the combined
contribution of power generated from on-site and off-site projects as well as renewable energygeneration feeding into the grids where our sites are located. Third-parMy-verified energyconsumption data is one year in arears for the CY2019 and CY2020 years. For CY2021, the latestenergy consumption data was used. This was used in combination with the electricity procured fromour renewable energy projects and the most recent grid fuel mix information obtained from theInternational Energy Agency for the regions where we operate. This estimate does not include energydata for our FlipkarM business. We believe excluding FlipkarM data will have a negligible impact on ourestimate.
6. Calculated in accordance with the 
RE100 technical criterial. RE100 defines renewable electricity
consumption as the ability to make unique claims on the use of renewable electricity generation and
its attributes.
7. Calculated in accordance with WalmarM’s Project Gigaton Accounting Methodology, available on
the WalmarM Sustainability Hub. Suppliers submit information during a Project GigatonTM reporMingseason; figures reporMed are for the reporMing season that took place during the corresponding fiscalyear.
8. Because WalmarM does not restrict suppliers to reporMing only on emissions avoidance and
reduction efforMs that are attributable to the suppliers’ business with WalmarM, actions taken andreporMed through Project Gigaton cannot be used to measure WalmarM’s scope 3 emissions, eitherabsolutely or in year-over-year reductions.10/25/22  1 02 PM AstraZeneca  Us ng purchas ng power to acce erate act on  CDP

AstraZeneca is a global science-led biopharmaceutical company that has
been disclosing through CDP for over a decade and has been ranked on theCDP A List for both climate change and water security for six consecutiveyears.
Since 2015, AstraZeneca has delivered a 59% reduction in their Scope 1 and 2
emissions and in October 2021, AstraZeneca became one of the firstcompanies worldwide to have its emissions reductions targets verified by theScience Based Targets initiative’s new Net-Zero Standard.
With action on Scope 1 and 2 GHG emission reductions well underway,
AstraZeneca has accelerated action with its suppliers to reduce Scope 3emissions, aided by its 
CDP Supply Chain membership.10/25/22  1 02 PM AstraZeneca  Us ng purchas ng power to acce erate act on  CDP

AstraZeneca has set an ambitious target to halve their entire value chain
footprint (from 2015 baseline) by 2030 leading to a 90% reduction by 2045(from 2019 baseline).
“Our Scope 3 footprint is more than 20 times greater than our Scope 1 and 2
footprint, and our ambitions will only be achieved through close collaborationwith our supply chain partners, ” says Jenny Perrie, AstraZeneca’s Scope 3lead in the Global Procurement team.
“We cannot do this alone; we need to know our suppliers are on the same road
to net-zero. So we have set the goal that, by 2025, 95% of our key suppliersand partners should have verified science-based targets, and we are workingclosely with our sector peers to support the progression to a low carboneconomy. ”
Perrie emphasized the role of CDP Supply Chain membership in achieving
supply chain decarbonization: “We rely on our suppliers’ CDP submissions togain consistent insight into our Scope 3 emissions.

As a large collective source of carbon emissions, businesses have a key role
to play in addressing the climate crisis. The accelerating threats to theplanet have more companies pledging action to reduce theirenvironmental impact, including some goals aligned with the ParisAgreement that incorporates a net zero emissions target for 2050. Butother businesses see a more urgent need and are accelerating their climatework to go beyond reduced emissions and establish methods andmaterials that enhance the environment—taking responsibility to ensureour planet’s health for future generations.  
One business leading through regenerative innovation and a commitmentto sustainability is Allbirds, a footwear and apparel company known for itsinnovative materials and carbon neutral commitment. The companyrecently announced new, aggressive sustainability commitments for 2025and 2030, including a 50% reduction in its per-product carbon footprintin 2025 that expands to a near-zero per-unit carbon footprint by 2030.These goals translate to a science-based target to reduce absolute scope 1,2, and 3 emissions by 42% by 2030—and Allbirds aims to bring othersalong to amplify this impact.
Hana Kajimura, Head of Sustainability at Allbirds, says the company will
focus on regenerative agriculture, renewable materials, and responsibleenergy use to meet 10 quantitative commitments for its materials andpractices by 2025. These include getting 100% of its wool fromregenerative sources, reducing the use of raw materials by 25%, sourcing100% renewable energy at facilities it owns and operates, as well aseducating consumers on lower-impact ways to clean footwear and apparel.10/25/22  1 13 PM W th New Susta nab ty Comm tments  A b rds Acce erates A Crad e To Grave Approach  That ncorporates Consumers And Supp y Cha n

includes product use, end of life, and corporate emissions,” she says. “Wethink we should be accountable to the impact of our product even after itleaves our door. For example, on customer use, there are a few things thatwe have control over and then there are a few things that we can do ourbest to influence.” 
In announcing the new commitments, Kajimura and others at Allbirds
acknowledge the significant challenge—and that the company’s individualimpact has its limits. So, as it has done with product development and as amember of the Certified B Corporation community, Allbirds will shareinformation about the quantitative process behind its new climate goalsthrough open collaboration and assist companies and growers in itssupply chain with transitions to clean energy or regenerative practices.

“Our ambition is to reverse climate change through better business,”
Kajimura says. “Targets for 2050 are beyond the scope of any onesustainability person’s career or the public’s attention span. Those goalsare important to set that long-term ambition, but so is near-termaccountability, and that’s why we have 2025 as the focus.”

at Allbirds ALLBIRDSonly do because we’ve demonstratedsuch a strong track record over the lastfew years. As we neared our fifthbirthday, which was just this March, westarted to think about what the next fiveyears would look like and felt ready tomake commitments toward that future.
This work really logically built off our initiative to label all of our productswith their carbon footprint, because in large part that was done to holdourselves accountable to showing that number come down over time. Nowwe are committing to reduce our per-unit or per-product carbon footprintby 50% by the end of 2025 and by 95% by 2030—that's all relative to whatthat per-product number would have been in 2025 without further actionto limit the emissions.  
We have really anchored the message and storytelling around that per-product footprint, because it aligns with that label you see on our product.What that means quite practically is that in 2030 that label on our productwill be less than 1 kilogram of CO2 per product. As the world conversationreally shifts toward this idea of true zero emissions—take offsets off thetable and take action to reduce our impact—we wanted to see how muchwe could reduce our emissions.   
Marquis: In pursuit of that goal, how do you consider how individualcomponents of footwear or apparel contribute to emissions?   
Kajimura: Most companies set the target in line with science-basedtargets, which is what are needed to keep warming below 1.5 or 2 degreesC, and then they work backward on how to get there. That takes a long

you're actually going to achieve it. It leaves you with this big questionmark—an innovation gap.  
We actually did the opposite and looked at that stacked bar of ourproduct’s carbon footprint broken down across the phases of materials,manufacturing, transportation, product use, end of life, offices and retailstores, and even our growth rate. We just started shaving that bar down bysaying: What if our wool was all regenerative agriculture? What if ourfactories ran on 100% renewables? What if our customers were washingand drying our product less often? How much would each of those thingscontribute to a reduction in our carbon footprint?  
That’s how we arrived at the 50% by 2025 and 95% by 2030. We can onlydo that because we've built such an infrastructure around data collectionand really knowing the impact of each of our products. We were helped bythe fact that we have a relatively limited number of products and arelatively contained supply chain to really have our arms around the exactimpact—truly down to the lace level.
Existing materials can always be better. We have this target now to do
100% of our wool farmed regeneratively. Wool today actually has a prettyhigh carbon footprint, although it’s a renewable and natural material. Butthrough regenerative practices we could imagine it will become carbonnegative, so that’s one bucket of innovation. Others are around increasingbio content while maintaining performance. That’s the real unlock for thewhole footwear industry, honestly, is how do we increase the level of biocontent in our foams—whether it’s the sole of the shoe or the insole—without degrading performance, without making it like a stiff, heavy10/25/22  1 13 PM W th New Susta nab ty Comm tments  A b rds Acce erates A Crad e To Grave Approach  That ncorporates Consumers And Supp y Cha n

Marquis: The goals incorporate some broad shifts across very different
types of activities. For example, moving to all regenerative agriculture foryour wool is very different than getting consumers to wash their shoes lessfrequently—a consumer education issue. Across those different areas,what do you see as most challenging and how do you plan to address thosechallenges?  
Kajimura: They do take different approaches. Regenerative agriculturerequires working directly with farmers on the ground in New Zealand tohave specific conversations about what it would take to get you to whereyou need to be. Similarly, it requires conversations with ourmanufacturing partners to ask if they have looked into on-site solar andsuggesting some financing mechanisms to help them get there.
The 10 specific targets for 2025 collectively contribute to that 50%
reduction. The hardest one of all is material innovation because effectivelywe’re committing to 75% of our total material use being from sustainablysourced natural or recycled materials, as well as about a 25% reduction inthe carbon intensity of the materials that we’re using. Achieving thosetargets is going to take inventing materials that currently do not exist. Wehave a track record of that;  SweetFoam is a great example, because it led
to a pretty substantial reduction in our per-unit carbon footprint. But wehave to do that again and again over the next five years.  
A big part of getting to this point where we’re ready to make thesecommitments public was doing a very detailed feasibility assessment tounderstand the investment required. The rhetoric of sustainability beingmore expensive is certainly true to an extent.

that’s associated with recycled materials or natural materials is real and itis a significant investment. But other initiatives that also help withsustainability—like shipping predominantly through ocean versus air orjust using fewer materials and minimizing waste and becoming moreefficient—save so much money that this whole strategy taken togethersaves us money on a per-product basis. Yes, sustainability can beexpensive and it can take longer and it’s harder and newer. But when youlook at it holistically, it can actually be good for business as well.  
Marquis: You mentioned factors like people like washing less and alsoaccounting for end of use. It seems to be a big challenge to control thoseitems which happen after the product leaves your possession.  Can you say
more about how you will address those issues?   
Kajimura: We really took the cradle-to-grave approach quite seriouslybecause we think we should be accountable for the impact even after itleaves our door. So on customer use, there are a few things that we havecontrol over and then there are a few things where we can do our best toinfluence them.  
In terms of what we have control over, we can create products that requireless care such as materials that reduce odor so maybe you don’t have towash your T-shirt as often.   Secondly, we can provide education on how to
do this. Some of our apparel hang tags now give recommendations forlow-impact care, and we plan to ramp that up. We also can incentivizeconsumers to switch to renewable energy sources where that’s an option.

Marquis: How does the company plan to drive their pursuit throughout
the organization and supply chain—the workers who are importantstakeholders and crucial for the company’s success?  
Kajimura: While the 10 goals are going to be managed by thesustainability team, we have direct authority and accountability over noneof them. It’s our product teams, material teams, supply chain teams. Increating the goals, we wanted to make sure the whole process was asinclusive and stakeholder based as possible. It started with outreach andinterviews to our employees, our investors, our suppliers, our customersand asking them what we should do, what we are doing well, what wecould do better. When we reached out to our strategic suppliers, theythanked us for asking because they said changes are usually just pushedon them.  
Once we have the strategy created, we have to determine how we’re going
to hold ourselves accountable. It starts at the highest level with our publicbenefit corporation status and B Corp status. They help ensure that there’sa certain level of employee buy-in because almost all of our employeescame to work at Allbirds to work on this mission. They’re excited to havepart of their day-to-day role be so explicitly tied to sustainability. On thelegal side it ensures that the business has a legal mandate to be lookingout for all stakeholders, including the environment.
We still have to make the business case and show that pursuing these
sustainability goals also helps with margins and financial performance.Our employee bonus is tied to achieving reductions in our carbon target.10/25/22  1 17 PM Ever ane Maps Out ts Path To Becom ng A Net Zero Company

Everlane wants to drive down its emissions and carbon footprint — and
with greater transparency.
Using Science Based Targets, an initiative that emphasizes data and
standardization in a company’s efforts to reduce their carbon footprint,Everlane is moving towards becoming a net zero company by 2050.
“It’s a globally recognized initiative designed to encourage change and
reduce misinformation,” Michael Preysman, Executive Chair and ClimateActivist of Everlane, says. “By no measure is carbon measurement aperfect science, but with SBTs we can be simple, clear and consistent.”
Through this new initiative, Everlane will take a three tiered approach:
scope 1 and 2 focuses on their stores and headquarters with a goal toreduce absolute emissions by 46% by 2030; scope 3 looks at theirproducts, with a target of reducing product emissions by 55% by 2030. By2050, the company aims to fully reach net zero emissions.
“Everlane's footprint from our own employees and stores is very small in
the grand scheme of our total impact,” Preysman explains. “We've donetremendous work there to run stores on renewable energy, reduce traveland ensure our team is engaged, but ultimately our focus is on ourmanufacturing. The pieces we produce through factory partners and withmaterials from around the world, represent almost our entire impact.”
To be exact, the company states that 99% of their total greenhouse gas
emissions (GHG) footprint comes from scope 3. In its manufacturing,Everlane earlier committed to transitioning to organic cotton andeliminating virgin plastic from their supply chain.

Re: File No. S7 -10-22 
The Enhancement and Standardization  of 
Climate -Related Disclosures for Investors  
Release No. 3 3-11042; 34 -94478  
  
Dear Ms. Countryman:  
We are grateful for the opportunity to present our views on the above -captioned release (the 
“Proposing Release”) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) , 
proposing rule changes  that would require registrants to include certain climate -related 
information in their registration statements, annual reports, and audited financial statements. This 
letter respectfully submits our comments.  
We believe that climate  change is an important societal issue that deserves appropriate attention 
by governments, regulators, and the public at large , and that public companies can make critical 
contributions  in this regard .  We recognize that  investors have increasingly focused on 
environmental, social and governance factors in their investment and voting decisions , including 
by seeking more transparency regarding how public companies consider, manage and respond to 
the risks and opportunities presented by cl imate change . We agree that the Commission has a n 
important  role to play in facilitating  consistent and comparable climate -related disclosure s for 
investors.  We believe that the Commission can do this in a manner that both facilitates capital 
formation by  providing investors with decision -useful information and fairly considers  the 
associated cost of compliance  for public companies . Page 2   
 The proposed  rules are designed  to elicit consistent, comparable, and decisi on-useful information 
on a topic of great importance to many investors and the public, which we believe is an 
important and achievable goal .  We are , however,  concerned that the scale  and granularity of the 
proposed disclosures may go beyond what investors truly need  and that the Commission may not 
have adequately considered the challenge place d on public companies that will need to comply 
with these requirements , especially on su ch an accelerated timeline .  Importantly, the proposed 
rules have raised and will continue to raise questions about the Commission ’s authority , which 
will only result in delay ing achievement  of the important goal of clear and consistent climate -
related disclosures . 
Over the course of several years , the Commission has successfully modernized its disclosure 
framework, using a principles -based approach to ensure that investors receive information that is 
material to their decision -making while eliminating  disclosures that do not meet this standard , 
while  considering the cost and impact of compliance with new disclosure  requirements. Our 
comments below are designed to provide the Commission with alternatives to consider in 
connection with the adoption of final rules that are consistent with the Commission’s principles -
based approach .  
We do not believe that the significant burdens the proposed rules would impose on registrants 
and the extensive related investment s in human capital, systems and management time  were 
adequately considered . The work that each registrant will need to perform to determine which 
components of the new disclosure regime apply to it, to collect relevant data,  and to prepare, 
review and validate responsive  disclosure will require significant preparation that demands  an 
implementation period meaningfully longer than what has been proposed . Without a 
reconsideration of the effective dates for the proposed rules , registrants would need to begin the 
implementation work prior to the rules even being finalized in order to meet their disclosure 
obligations under the proposed timeline.  
We respectfully submit that certain components of the proposed rules can be modified in ways 
that are consistent with the needs of investors  for decision -useful, comparable disclosures  while 
lessening the burden s and costs for public companies and their shareholders, directors , executive 
officers  and employees .  
Financial Statements Disclosure  
Proposed Rule 14-02 of Regulation S -X would require registrants to disclose the financial impact 
of severe weather events and other natural conditions  or transition activities  on any relevant line 
item in the consolidated financial statements.  It would also require quantifying the amount of 
mitigation or transition expenditure.  We hav e the following concerns and recommendations with 
respect to this requirement : Page 3   
 • Absence of Traditional Process Preceding New Financial Statement Disclosure s. The 
high quality accounting standards underlying p ublic company financial statements are the 
result of decades -long collaboration among securities regulators and  accounting standard 
setters such as  the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)  and the International 
Accounting  Standards Board (“IASB ”), public company accounting and financial 
reporting  departments, and auditors. This collaboration is important because it leads to 
disclosure that is meaningful to investors and that lends itself to validation through 
effective audit procedures.  It does no t appear that the financial statement disclosure 
requirements contained in the proposed rules are the result of a detailed consultation 
process involving  these essential stakeholders.  
• De Minimis Threshold Too Low . We do not think the proposed 1% de minimis  threshold 
is appropriat e for eliciting decision -useful information for investors because it will 
capture impacts that are immaterial. The Proposing Release  notes this threshold was 
chosen so as to reduce the risk of underreporting but  we are concer ned that  it has been set 
so low that it creates a new risk of overreporting  that inundate s investors  with irrelevant 
detail . The 1% threshold is also notably inconsistent with other thresholds used for 
financial statement disclosure, such as the 5% standard  for establishing materiality under 
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99.  Additionally, with respect to severe weather events and 
natural conditions and transition activities, the 1% threshold applies to the value of each 
line item, which could result in a company providing the required  disclosures related to a 
change that is immate rial to a line item that itself is immaterial.   Companies are currently 
required to dis cuss in Management’s Discussion and Analysis the reasons for material 
changes in financial statement  line items .  We have seen this requirement almost 
uniformly applied as companies responded to the global pandemic  and discussed the 
impact of COVID -19 on their results and financial condition .  This proposed  new 
financial statement disclosure would be  in addition to this existing requirement and 
would include i mpacts on the financial statements that, by implication and definition,  are 
not material.  This disclosure would thus focus investors on immaterial financial 
statement impacts and present a distorted perspective as the focus would only be on 
climate -relate d matters , ignor ing other factors that could have had a greater financial 
impact  on the registrant’s results of operations or financial condition . In fact, disclosure 
that is solely focused on climate -related impacts  while not discussing other factors  may 
be misleading to investors .  
• Aggregation Concept Unworkable . The proposed rules compound the challenges of a 1% 
threshold with an aggregation concept that would require financial statement disclosure 
not only of any applicable event, condition or activity  that has had an impact in excess of 
that threshold, but also of those  with an impact of less than 1%  when the ir aggregate 
absolute values exceed that threshold. The proposed rules would thu s mandate the 
disclosure and audit of individual events, conditions or activities  the impact of which may Page 4   
 be significantly less than 1%  on any line item in the registrant’s financial statements . The 
resources that registrants would need to devote to collecting, analyzing, and presenting 
that information, and having it audited,  appears out of proportion to the limited 
usefulness such information would hold for investors .  
• Severe Weather Events and Natural Conditions Are Vague Concepts . The proposed 
rules leave the concept of “sever e weather events and other natural conditions” 
undefined , other than to illustrate them with examples . The se categories are not intuitive, 
especially in combination. An “event” generally refers to something that oc curs at a 
particular point in time , while a “condition” is typically something the prevails over an 
extended period. A hurricane could be an event, but would not be a “condition” (although 
the fact that hurricanes occur more frequently in a particular regi on or during a particular 
time of the year may be). Conversely, the fact that winters tend to be cold in the 
northeastern United States and accompanied by snow and ice is a well -known “natural 
condition.”  The proposed rules leave a number of questions  unanswered .  Should 
registrants try to isolate the impact of seasonal weather changes on each line item in their 
financial statements?  Or are the proposed rules intended to capture a narrower concept of 
“natural condition” that is tied to changes  in natural conditions caused by climate 
change?  If so, how should registrants go about isolating those and distinguishing them 
from constant natural conditions, or from changes in natural conditions that are due to 
factors other than climate change?  
 
• Operational Perimeter Unclear . The proposed rules provide little guidance for how  
registrants are supposed to determine how to define their operational perimeter s when 
assessing the impact of severe weather events and other natural conditions on their 
financi al statements. One of the examples highlighted by the proposed rules are  changes 
to revenue or costs from disruptions to business operations or supply chains . It is unclear 
how the Commission intends for registrants to comply with this disclosure requireme nt. 
If a U.S.-based registrant has a supplier in China , does that registrant need to monitor 
weather events “and other natural conditions” in China to determine whether those have 
affected the prices charged by its supplier , or the volume it can deliver, which may have 
forced the registrant to source a portion of its supplies from other vendors at higher costs?  
How would registrants go about determining what portion of a price increase was due to 
severe weather events or other natural conditions, as oppose d to general economic  
conditions, dynamics in the local labor market, raw material prices or other factors?  
• Audit Burden Not Commensurate With Investor Benefit . The proposed financial 
statement disclosure will be subject to internal control over financial reporting and audit  
procedures,  potentially covering several years , which will create costs that are  out of 
proportion to the value of information that is not material to  investors. As noted above, 
quantifying the impact of the relevant factors may involve significant judgments on the Page 5   
 part of management, making the corresponding audit process challenging and time -
consuming, all of this for information that may have had an impact of 1% on any line 
item in the registrant’s financial statements.  
Recommendations  
• Eliminate Financial Statement Disclosure . We respectfully urge the Commission  to 
consider eliminating th e proposed financial statement disclosures entirely from the final 
release . If the Commission believes that requiring this disclosure in the financial 
statements  is important , we recommend that it be preceded by a robust and consultative 
standard setting process led by the  FASB  (and, for IFRS reporters, the IASB) .  The FASB 
initiated, as part of its 2021 Agenda Consultation process , a dialogue on how financial 
statements could be enhanced  with disclosures related to ESG and the effect of ESG 
factors on the financial statements.  We ask that the Commission allow the FASB’s 
process to continue . 
• Move Relevant Disclosure to MD&A . If the Commission wishes to retain some  
disclosure  regarding the financial statement impact of certain climate -related matters , we 
respectfully suggest that it would be better  positioned in MD&A, where registrants 
already describe other factors that have had material effects on their results.  Determining 
the external causes for changes in financial statement line items involves a degree of 
judgment and estimation that is much more subjective and uncertain  than that involved in 
the preparation of financial statements .  It is unclear how events or transition activities 
that are not solely the result of climate -related matters shoul d be disclosed.  For example, 
how would a company that chooses electric vehicles to replace its aging fleet disclose the 
climate -related financial impact of such a decision ? The severe weather events and other 
natural conditions that the proposed rules would require registrants to analyze for 
potential financial impacts are similar to  the known trends and uncertainties disclosure  
affecting a registrant’s results or financial condition that are required to be considered in 
MD&A. The relevant discussion in  MD&A should be permitted to be qualitative in 
nature and quantitative only to the extent the relevant information is readily available and 
material.    
• Increase Threshold, Narrow Line Items, and Exclude Indirect Effects . If the 
Commission nevertheless deci des to retain financial statement disclosure, we  recommend  
raising  the threshold  for disclosure  to 5%, reducing the burden on registrants and 
ensuring that  investors are not overloaded with immaterial information  in the financial 
statements . The Commission should also narrow the requirement to specified key line 
items ( e.g., revenue, operating income and expenses, and cash flow from operations) that 
need to be analyzed and considered for disclosure . Finally, the Commission should Page 6   
 explicitly exclude  from required disclosure any indirect effects such as those  which are 
due to the impact on  a registrant’s  customers or suppliers .  
Governance , Risk  and Targets  Disclosure  
Proposed Items 1501 , 1502 and 1503  of Regulation S -K would require detailed disclosure  about 
board and management processes related to climate -related risks , climate -related business 
strategy, and climate -related risk management . In addition, proposed Item 1506 of Regulation S -
K would require certain disclosure with respect to climate -related targets and goals. Our key 
concerns with respect this proposed disclosure are as follows:  
• Distorting Board Priorities . The proposed rules would require registrants to provide a 
great deal of information about their board’s approach to climate -related risks, including 
whether and how the board considers climate -related risks, and the process and frequency 
by which they stay inf ormed  without consideration of the risk prioritization that every 
board must consider . Public companies face numerous risks in their businesses , of which 
climate -related risks represent just one category, and for many companies it is not the 
most important  one or even among  the top risks  the company faces . The required 
disclosure s will pressure companies to elevate climate -related risks over others merely to 
allow the company to disclose “ board level climate action ” by putting climate matters on 
the already  full agendas for board and committee meeting s in an effort  to manage public 
perception.   
• Pressure to Add Climate Experts Adverse for Effective Governance . We are further 
concerned about the implications of requiring registrants to identify directors who have 
climate -related risk expertise  and to detail the nature of their expertise  in public filings . 
Companies have directors  with varied and overlapping skill s and experience . The 
membership of the board is selected to ensure that the board ha s the members with the 
necessary skills  and experience  to effectively  oversee management . Requiring disclosure 
on the climate -related skills of board members may push companies towards adding 
climate experts to their boards at the expense of a director with more necessary skills or 
experience.  In some cases, climate -related experience on the board may not be the best 
way for a company and the board to manage  and oversee  overall enterprise -wide  risks as 
supporting the board with appropriate internal or external resources  would provide the 
board with the subject matter expertise that is needed . Having to select board members 
for narrowly pr escribed subject matter expertise rather than criteria relevant for good 
governance may adversely affect board effectiveness.  (Similar concerns apply to the 
Commission ’s separate propo sal to require disclosure about director cyber security 
expertise.)  Page 7   
 • Increased Liability Exposure for Designated Climate Experts . Importantly , designating 
certain individuals as climate experts may expose them to increased liability by tagging 
them with responsibility for oversight or management of these risks.  
• Forced  Disclosure of Internal Goal -Setting and Goal -Tracking . We are also concerned 
that the requirement to disclose climate -related targets or goals is overly intrusive and 
without counterpart in other parts of the Commission’s disclosure framework. We 
recognize that companies that publicly announce specific targets  related to climate 
matters should be required to provide the necessary support to explain how they expect to 
achieve these publicly announced goals. Public companies , however,  are faced with many 
challenges in growing and managing their businesses and reg ularly set internal goals on a 
variety of matters  for operational purposes, to motivate teams or to measure performance . 
Many of these goals are not shared public ly. The proposed rules will subject registrants to 
increased liability and public scrutiny of their efforts which  could have the chilling effect 
of discouraging companies from embarking on and refining their  goal-setting in the first 
place.  The same is true for the required disclosure of any internal carbon price that 
registrants may be using as part of their climate -related business strategy.  
• Competitively Harmful Forced Disclosure of Internal Scenario Analysis . We are 
concerned about the r equirement to disclose the details of any scenario analysis that a 
registrant uses to assess the resilience of its business strategy to climate -related risks. If a 
registrant has opted to use scenario analysis, it will be required to share the scenarios it  
considered and the projected principal financial impacts on its business strategy under 
each scenario, including both quantitative and qualitative information. This would force 
registrants to reveal highly sensitive financial planning information to compe titors.  
Recommendations  
• Revise  Climate -Specific Governance Disclosure . We propose that the required 
disclosure on board and management governance practices with respect to climate -related 
risks be revised . If the Commission believes that the current governance disclosure about 
board risk oversight pursuant to Item 407 of Regulation S -K is inadequate, that disclosure  
could be expanded to require a discussion of  key risks and how boards manage key risks , 
without mandating  a specific discussion of climate risk  where a company has not 
identified climate as a key risk . This more principles -based approach will provide space 
for boards to handle  their own risk management processes while providing adequate 
information for investors. It will also provide investors with the necessary information to 
assess whether the board and the company are considering the right risks and if they are 
managing and overseeing management’s handling of the risk adequately.  Page 8   
 • Eliminate Climate Expertise Disclosure . Likewise, we propose a more principles -based 
approach to disclosure around directo r skill sets .  Companies should be required to 
identify th e skills  and experience that are sought for in directors  taking into account the 
company’s business, its competitive environment, its business strategy and the material 
risks it faces , rather than specifically identifying whether it  has climate expertise  or any 
other particular skill or experience  on the board .  Current Item 401 of Regulation S -K 
requires disclosure of specific skills and experiences that make an individual director 
qualified , which should, for those companies with effectively constituted boards, match 
up with the skills and experience that the board has identified are necessary to effectively 
oversee management . For companie s where climate -related expertise is a skill and 
experience that is sought after,  the disclosure would describe as much in response to this 
existing item.   
• Create Liability Safe Harbor . If the Commission chooses to retain the requirement to 
identify climate experts on the board and in management, we respectfully propose that 
the Commission provide a liability safe harbor similar to the one s available  for audit 
committee financial experts  and, under proposed rules, for cybersecurity experts.  
• Limit Goal -Setting and Goal -Tracking  Disclos ure to Publicly Announced  Targets . We 
also respectfully suggest companies be required to disclose information about their  
climate -related targets  only for targets that they have publicly announced . This will 
ensure that investors have full transparency about the key parameters  of climate -related 
targets, the steps companies plan to take to meet those targets, and the progress they are 
making in tha t regard , all without unduly interfering in corporate governance and risk 
management by forcing companies to disclose internal targets that may be too 
preliminary  or too competitively sensitive to warrant public disclosure . 
• Eliminate Mandator y Scenario Analysis Disclosure . We respectfully recommend 
eliminating the requirement for registrants to provide information about any internal 
scenario analyses they may have conducted.  
Green House Gas  Emissions  
The proposed rules include very prescriptive disclosure requirements with respect to registrants’ 
greenhouse gas emissions .  We have the following  concerns : 
• Unclear Materiality Determination for Scope 3 Emissions . Proposed Item 1504  of 
Regulation S -K requires a registrant to disclose its  total Scope 3 emissions for a given 
year if the emissions are material or if the registrant has set a greenhouse gas  emissions 
reduction target or goal that includes Scope 3 emissions . The Proposing Release 
acknowledg es that the proportions of  emission types can vary greatly across industries , 
mentions that some companies consider Scope 3 emissions material that cross a 40% Page 9   
 threshold of total emissions , but also cautions  that quantitative analysis alone will be 
insufficient for a materiality  determination . 
• Scope 3 Emissions Required to be Quantified Even if Ultimately Immaterial . In the 
absence of clear materiality guidance, registrants may feel compelled to quantify their 
Scope 3 emissions in order to determine whether they are in fact mater ial, which will 
itself be an extensive undertaking . Registrants will need to  attempt to collect this 
information from various outside parties  who will vary widely in how prepared  or willing  
they are to provide it. Registrants will not have the ability to compel third parties  to 
report this data and will often not have contracted with suppliers to provide this data as 
part of the ir ongoing relationship. Significant  resources will need to be  expended for this 
determination effort even if total Sco pe 3 emissions ultimately turn out not to be  material  
and therefore not subject to disclosure in the absence of a relevant Scope 3 target . 
• Defining and Collecting Scope 3 Data Challenging . As the Commission acknowledges, 
measuring Scope 3 emissions would b e challenging for many registrants. This is 
particularly true of companies with large and diverse sets of different types of customers 
and suppliers. Those companies are typically not in a position to request value chain 
emissions information from those cu stomers or suppliers, and many of those customers or 
suppliers do not report their emissions data publicly, if they collect it at all.  Practices 
around the definition and reporting of Scope 3 emissions are still very much evolving, 
and forcing a one -size-fits-all standard in this regard seems premature.  
• Including Entities That Are Not Fully Consolidated . The proposed rules would require 
registrants to include non-controlled equity investees on a proportionate basis in all of 
their greenhouse gas emissions disclosure. This provides less flexibility than the GHG 
Protocol and will not be practical for registrants that lack rights to receive that 
information from their equity investees.  
Recommendations  
• Scope 3 Disclosure Only for Companies that have Publicly Set Scope 3 Targets . We 
respectfully suggest that the Commission revise proposed Item 1504  of Regulation S -K to 
require disclosure of Sco pe 3 emissions information only in the event a company has 
publicly set  a Scope 3 target or goal. Given the challenges around determining materiality 
and the diffuse nature of Scope 3 emissions, the disclosure burden should be limited to 
only those companies that have publicly committed to  a corresponding target.  If the 
Commi ssion wishes to retain the materiality trigger, we propose modifying the 
requirement so registrants without a Scope 3 target but with material Scope 3 emissions 
are permitted to describes their strategies for addressing those in a qualitative manner.  Page 10   
 • Permit Alternative Scope 3 Definitions . The proposed rule should also be modified so 
that the registrant is able to reasonably define what comprises their Scope 3 emissions 
and then provide a narrower set of decision -useful metrics  related to the target th at has 
been set, such as their Scope 3 baseline, the timetable they have set  and the progress  
made towards the target, rather than the more extensive disclosure contained in the 
proposed rule s.  
• Limit Emissions Disclosure to Fully Consolidated Entities . To protect registrants 
against having to report emissions information without access to the underlying data, we 
recommend that mandatory emissions disclosures be limited to registrants and their fully 
consolidated subsidiaries.  
Disclosure Location  
The proposed rules would include the new disclosures in registrants’ annual reports and 
registration statements. We believe that until greenhouse gas emissions reporting has become a 
more standardized process, registrants should not be required to report emissions information on 
the same timeline as the audited financial statements that must be included in an Annual Report 
on Form 10 -K. To allow sufficient preparation time, we recommend that registrants be permitted 
to report that information in a Current R eport on Form 8 -K by the end of the registrant’s second 
quarter of the following fiscal year.   This information can be incorporated into the Annual Report 
on Form 10 -K in the same manner as the Part III information in the Annual Report on Form 10 -
K is inco rporated from the later filed proxy statement on Schedule 14A.  
We further recommend that the disclosure of climate -related risks, governance, and risk 
management are all more appropriate in a registrant’s proxy statement or information statement , 
where it can naturally be presented in the context of the registrant’s other disclosures about 
governance and risk management oversight.  We believe that investors would expect to see these 
disclosures in the proxy statement and that these disclosures would be  more useful to investors  
when presented together  with those other governance and risk management matters .  This 
information can be required in the Annual Report on Form 10 -K as Part III information, which 
would also be  permitted to be included in the later file d proxy statement.  
Separating these disclosures from the Annual Report on Form 10 -K would provide companies 
with more time to prepare and consider these disclosures set apart from the pressure of 
completing fiscal year end filings.  
Compliance Accommodations and Timelines  
We believe that the proposed rules present particular challenges in certain mergers and 
acquisitions transactions, in relation to newly public companies, and from an overall timeline 
perspective.  Our concerns are the following : Page 11   
 • Newly Acquired Businesses and Stock Mergers . In their current form, the proposed rules 
do not provide any relief for newly acquired subsidiaries of public companies or for 
private targets in business combinations with public companies. Given the scale of  the 
disclosure and work necessary to comply with the proposed rules, we anticipate that 
registrants will need to screen potential business combination partners for those who are 
in a position to produce this extensive disclosure quickly if no accommodatio ns are added 
to the final release. Having to prepare this disclosure for a private target on a stand -along 
basis before the acquiring registrant can file its Form S -4 or F -4 to register the securities 
being issued in connection with the business combinatio n would materially delay those 
filings and significantly extend the overall transaction timeline. This would put public 
companies at a disadvantage when competing for attractive private targets.  
• Insufficient Overall Preparation Time . Under the effective da tes contemplated by t he 
Proposing Release  and assuming the proposed rules are adopted with an effective date in 
December 2022 , registrants would be required to begin including the extensive new 
disclosure in public filings as early as fiscal year 2023  for large accelerated filers, fiscal 
year 2024 for accelerated and non -accelerated filers, and fiscal year 2025 for smaller 
reporting companies . We are concerned  that this timeline does not allow sufficient time 
for registrants to prepare . The proposed rules  represent a dramatic addition to required 
disclosure and include some complex components, notably the financial statement 
disclosure and the greenhouse gas  emissions disclosure, which will require significant 
lead time.  
• Need to Retain and Onboard Attestation Providers and Other Vendors . In addition to 
creating their own internal processes, registrants will need to develop relationships with 
third parties for pu rposes of determining greenhouse gas  emissions and to satisfy the 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 attestation requirement. It is not clear how many entities are 
currently in a position to make Scope 1 and Scope 2 attestations and it may take some 
time for a sufficient  number of independent third parties to be viable . Auditors will also 
need adequate time to develop processes to audit the new financial statement disclosures. 
These challenges are exacerbated by the fact that the new rules are not yet in final form  
and will not be until later this year . 
Recommendations  
• Phase -In for Inclusion of Newly Acquired Businesses . We respectfully propose that the 
Commission include an accommodation for newly acquired businesses similar to the one 
currently afforded with respe ct to the reports and audits regarding internal control over 
financial reporting for newly acquired businesses. Registrants are permitted to exclude an 
acquired business from the assessment and audit of internal control over financial 
reporting for the yea r in which the acquisition occurred. This recognizes the time it may Page 12   
 take following the consummation of the acquisition to establish familiarity with the 
internal controls at the acquired business. Registrants should similarly be able to delay 
providing di sclosure under the proposed rules for a newly acquired business for a year to 
allow registrants and their attestation providers  and financial statement auditors to 
familiarize themselves with those businesses and gather and analyze the information 
relevant  for the extensive disclosures required under the new rules. This is of particular 
importance for the emissions  and the financial statement disclosures . 
• Phase -In for Newly Public Companies and Exemption for EGCs . To balance the 
benefits of additional clima te-related disclosures with the adverse impact the extensive 
new disclosure requirements may have on capital formation, we recommend that newly 
public companies be nefit from the same accommodations as smaller reporting 
companies , at least as they relate to emissions and financial statements disclosures, until 
the end of the first full fiscal after their going public transaction. Consistent with the 
exemption of emerging growth companies from the auditor attestation report on thei r 
internal control over financial reporting, we also recommend that emerging growth 
companies be exempt from any attestation requirements with respect to their emissions 
disclosures for as long as they retain that status.  
• Exclude Private Targets in Stock M ergers . We also respectfully recommend that the 
modifications to Forms S -4 and F -4 in the Proposing Release should not be adopted. If 
the target in a proposed merger is a private business, it is unlikely to have the extensive 
climate change disclosure prep ared in advance of entering into a business combination 
with a public company.  
• Extend Overall Compliance Timeline . We respectfully propose delaying each of the 
compliance dates for one fiscal year in order to allow registrants, third parties, and 
auditors sufficient time to prepare , review and audit  the new disclosure s. This additional 
time will allow registrants to create thoughtful and sustainable internal processes  and 
forge  relationships with trustworthy third parties . Additional time will also create s pace 
for climate -focused early adopters to set the tone by complying early and showcas ing 
best practices that other registrants can then emulate . 
• Extend Attestation and Scope 3 Timeline s. In addition to pushing back all the 
compliance date s by one year, we suggest further delaying the compliance date s for the 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions information attestation Scope 3 emissions information by an 
additional year. With r espect to atte station, thi s will allow sufficient time to identify and 
retain relevant providers and develop procedures. For Scope 3 em issions, the a dditional 
time will let registrants set expectations with third parties from which they need to  obtain 
information and to create processes to collect th at information moving forward.  Page 13

The study submitted to the SEC by WK Associates in June 2021, and this report 
evaluate amendment of the SEC’s oil and gas reserves disclosure regulations 
(Specifically Regulation S-X §210.4-103 and Regulation S-K §229.12024) to reflect 
effective CO 2 emissions. The proposed method is scientifically valid, straightforward for 
registrants to prepare and uncomplicated for investors to apply in securities analysis. 
The resulting data could be included in a balance sheet or income statement (by 
reference) to explain assumptions about the impact of climate transition risk on 
consolidated financial statement line items (as required by § 210.14-02 page 455 of the 
proposed rule). For example, this type of clarification may be useful when a registrant’s 
public greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets, or other expenses or 
capitalized costs, have a more than one percent absolute impact on the net present 
value of oil and gas reserves and related capitalized costs.

Executive Summary                                                                                                                          
The year 2021 proved a landmark in the history of the oil and gas industry. Obscured by both the 
pandemic and an understandable fixation on the expected upward trajectory of oil and gas demand in 
the current decade, a consensus emerged among the largest and most prominent industry forecasters 
that 2050 demand will fall below current levels. This despite an expected doubling of global GDP to 
2050, severing the virtual lockstep growth in hydrocarbon demand and economic growth witnessed over 
the last century. 
 
A key feature of investor appeal for oil and gas, despite frequent bouts of uneconomic returns, has always 
been rock solid demand growth, an oligopolistic market structure, and sufficient sustained advantage to 
return capital to shareholders in the form of high dividends and buybacks. With the potential removal 
of one leg of this stool, perhaps two, the industry is at the dawn of a new era of uncertainty and volatility. 
While there are certainly valid non-consensus forecasts, as is always the case in markets, when the bulk 
of analysis forecasts a strong energy transition over the next 25 years, investors should take note. 
 
Taking the average analyst estimates across the six providers below yields a forecast of 95 mb/d, 64 
mb/d and 40 mb/d (million barrels per day) for the high, middle and low demand scenarios respectively. 
With 2021 demand estimated at 96.4 mb/d, it’s striking that the consensus among the three best known 
independent forecasters, an equal number of integrated oil companies, as well as Bloomberg and IHS 
Markit, shows average demand in 2050 below current demand for the first time.

The prospect of significant energy transition challenges over the next three decades has not cooled a 
blazing hot runup for oil and gas securities today. Exploration and production companies, given that 
their valuation is almost solely based on reserves, without midstream and downstream operations, 
highlight this point well. Since the pandemic low the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 
ETF (NYSE: XOP), with holdings of 61 U.S. E&P companies has gained 267% as Brent has climbed 
175%, and the overall S&P has gained 101%. The reasons for this extraordinary runup, against the 
backdrop of a potential fundamental shift in the long-term dynamics of the industry, are numerous, 
including: a significant drawdown in oil inventories after a hard pandemic stop, historically low global 
spare capacity threatening to be overwhelmed by 2022 demand, and a sustained period of 
underinvestment leading to supply mismatches as demand conditions have shifted.

However, with any appreciable price gain comes a commensurate rise in implied performance 
expectations. Historically, the E&P industry has struggled to generate returns on capital above the cost 
of capital for extended periods of time, as exemplified by its performance over the last decade

As can be seen from the Figure above, current market prices for the constituents of the XOP are 
impounding many years of returns above the cost of capital (see column “GAP”). In fact, 80% of the 
 
 5
index is implying greater than 50 years of value creating returns (ROIC above WACC)! These frothy 
valuations are not only at odds with individual company return history (as seen in the rightmost column 
labeled “5 Year ROIC spread Actual”) as well as aggregate historical industry returns, but the current 
valuations also defy the consensus that an energy transition could ultimately bring oil and gas demand 
below current levels by 2050. While public market equity investors may be proceeding in a business-as-
usual fashion, E&P companies are experiencing clear financing stress related to the energy transition. 
Goldman Sachs estimates that the spread in the cost of capital of hydrocarbon versus renewable 
developments has widened by greater than ten percentage points over the last five years (Figure below). 
 
Exec Summary Figure 3 Project IRR for oil and gas and renewable projects by year of project sanction 
                
Source: Goldman Sachs 
  
When project IRRs, required returns on long duration, high-cost projects, increase significantly due to 
uncertainty around demand and the regulatory environment, fewer projects get funded, exploration 
budgets get cut and write-offs increase. This is validated by the expected 40% decline in the reinvestment 
ratio for all Oil & Gas in 2022 (based on current trends versus a 10-year average) and highlights an 
industry beset with poor regulatory clarity and lack of global coordination, in contrast with the electric 
 
 6
utility industry, which has seen positive reinvestment ratios due to price support and more clear 
regulation. A truism in the industry is that high oil prices are the best cure for high oil prices, as additional 
capacity ramps and the pendulum swings to oversupply. Over the last decade however, the number of 
climate-related shareholder resolutions has almost doubled and the percentage of investors voting in 
favor has almost tripled, to roughly 40%, with a targeted focus on energy producers rather than on final 
energy consumption. The prospect of continued shareholder pressure and sustained high financing costs 
may significantly delay what was in years past an almost certain setup for a price crash (now exacerbated 
by renewed energy security concerns due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine). This volatile backdrop shows 
no sign of abating, as few doubt the fact that a meaningful energy transition is on the horizon. This issue 
is particularly challenging for E&P companies, as undeveloped properties are major drivers of firm value. 
On a NAV basis, E&P companies typically trade well above the discounted value of their proved 
developed reserves, with the balance of the market value representing implied optionality on proved 
undeveloped properties (PUD), and possibly more distant P2, P3. Since PUDs require future capital 
investments, they’re keenly sensitive to economic conditions. The National Bureau of Economic 
Research (NBER) examined the relationship between firm value and proved reserves for 600 oil and gas 
firms in North America from 1999-2018 and found that proved undeveloped reserves growth and firm 
value were significantly negatively correlated. 
 
WK Associates built a model portfolio to test the carbon risk sensitivity embedded in proved 
undeveloped reserves. For the 30 E&P firms in this report, undeveloped proved reserves averaged 40% 
of total reserves on an annual basis over the last decade. While the growth of aggregate undeveloped 
reserves is important to valuation, the emissions potential and financing implications of the change in 
reserves mix needs to be disaggregated (as highlighted by LNG’s lower project IRR). The figure below 
shows the relationship between the change in emissions potential of undeveloped proved reserves and  
 7
Enterprise Value for the thirty E&P companies in Exec Summary Figure 2 over the last five years (we 
removed all firms in XOP that were not “pure play” upstream E&P companies). We plotted the change 
in undeveloped proved reserves over a given year, calculated the emissions potential of that change in 
reserves according to the hydrocarbon mix, and then performed a regression against Enterprise Value 
(firm value as dependent variable).

As can be seen, an even greater negative correlation exists (-0.54 coefficient, versus -0.23) between CO 2 
emissions and firm value. It’s important to note that the growth in undeveloped proved reserves alone 
is impactful, but that growth does not necessarily give rise to a linear increase in emissions. The exact 
quantity of rise or fall in metric tons of CO 2 depends on the mix of proved undeveloped hydrocarbons 
that rise or fall (i.e., oil, natural gas and NGL). 
 
We utilized emissions factors formulated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for each 
type of hydrocarbon, a standard adopted around the world by governments and companies alike 
(including the U.S. Department of Energy and Exxon Mobil, outlined in Appendix II of this report). In 
order to understand the impact of potential emissions from PUDs on equity performance we compared 
an equal-weighted portfolio of E&P company returns, utilizing the 30 companies outlined in this report, 
from 2017-2021. In the first scenario, we simply held all 30 companies for the entire period. As can be 
seen in the Figure below this generated a 158% return. We then rebalanced the portfolio each year and 
removed the top quintile emitters (i.e., largest increase in potential emissions from undeveloped proved 
reserves), replacing them with the bottom quintile performers, which mostly consisted of firms that 
reduced emissions.

Emissions-Based Portfolio Rebalancing

As can be seen, the portfolio return jumped dramatically to 208%, a move of 5000 basis points, or 32% 
improvement over the hold portfolio! An important observation from these data is that the growth or 
decline in PUDs and emissions, though highly correlated, sometimes diverged due to the relative mix of 
hydrocarbons. In addition to the potential portfolio implications outlined, there are individual security 
analysis benefits to utilizing a metric that tracks the potential emissions associated with undeveloped 
proved reserves, including the following: 
 
 Carbon Scoring  – As discussed earlier in this report, many hydrocarbon demand scenarios are 
now linked to emissions levels, where maximum allowable amounts are established in order to 
meet global warming targets. Increasingly, investment services and portfolio software providers 
are scoring an individual company’s alignment with temperature benchmarks, sometimes referred 
to as “carbon scoring”  where the analysis contrasts the company’s stated targets against a 
benchmark. Calculating the emissions potential of undeveloped proved reserves would allow 
analysts to quantify a PUD threshold, or a level of undeveloped reserves that might affect the 
firm’s ability to meet or exceed its stated emissions goals. 
 
 10
 
 Precision  -- Increasingly analysts are incorporating higher discount rates as a “blunt force” 
margin of safety when valuing some oil and gas investments. A few investors we spoke with are 
utilizing an additional 200-500 basis points on top of the calculated rate for more extreme 
physical and transition risks. Understanding the trajectory of the emissions potential of PUDs 
for an individual security can allow analysts to accept their calculated rate without a blunt 
instrument margin of safety, but with a valuation adjustment to reflect the idiosyncratic risk of 
either growing or declining emissions potential for the undeveloped proved assets of the 
valuation target. 
 
 Corporate Strategy – Clearly delineating emissions targets and the potential inherent in a firm’s 
undeveloped proved reserves can help a company understand where it fits in a country, regional, 
or global strategy. Having quantifiable metrics allows companies to manage what they measure, 
helping to explore the way in which carbon offsets or operational emissions reductions can 
balance against future expected emissions. If these potential emissions can be aggregated at a 
market level, it will improve market efficiency with respect to the overall trajectory of emissions 
in coming years, as well as give context to an individual company’s efforts within that overall 
path. 
 
Numerous institutional investor surveys over the last year have indicated that investors understand the 
potential materiality of climate change in the valuation of companies. In the Robeco 2021 Global Climate 
Survey of the 300 largest institutional investors, with a total of $23.4 trillion in assets under management, 
71% of respondents asserted that climate change was either a “significant factor” or “at the center” of 
investment policy (47% and 26% respectively). In addition, in the Greenwich 2021 survey of 101  
 11
investors with greater than $3B in assets, it was reported that 58% of respondents actively incorporated 
climate change considerations into their investment process, with approximately 75% doing so because 
the practice “improves risk-adjusted returns”. Despite majorities in both surveys acknowledging the 
importance of climate risk, a significant number cited the need for more reliable data, models and 
disclosures to effectively evaluate the risks. The lack of perceived in-house expertise was a strong limiting 
factor (40% of investors in the Greenwich survey), as many investors didn’t feel they had the requisite 
expertise to isolate the elements that impacted firm value. Of the respondents in the Greenwich survey 
roughly 31% utilized carbon emissions data as a factor in their internal analysis, leaving considerable 
room for more efficient pricing of this factor as adoption increases. As demonstrated in this report, 
under the right circumstances, investors can use these data to inform their analysis and generate 
potentially superior returns.

Introduction:  
The year 2021 witnessed a rapid increase in corporate climate commitments, as well as renewed vigor in 
globally synchronized efforts to reduce GHG emissions1. Over the course of last year an august group 
of independent forecasters, including the IEA, WoodMac and Rystad, all issued reports on the future of 
oil and gas demand. With most country-level NetZero commitments centered on the year 20502, virtually 
all the named forecasters estimated significantly lower oil demand by that date (even under scenarios with 
only moderate rates of structural change in the energy industry). Against this uncertain long-long-term 
backdrop, oil and gas securities soared in 2021, largely indicating business as usual in public markets (and 
highlighting a disconnect with the distant consensus). While historical oil and gas returns have been 
persistently uneconomic over multi-year periods3, the industry’s insatiable demand profile has always 
provided a modicum of sustained advantage, along with its oligopolistic market structure. With that 
demand picture now blurry at best, the next thirty years pose a profound threat to what has historically 
been lockstep growth with global GDP over the last century4.  
 
This report attempts to assess the performance expectations impounded in current prices for a 
representative group of upstream E&P companies. It will also introduce a metric that can help investors 
assess the climate risk embedded in a company’s reserves. The report consists of three parts: (1). Analysis 
of the “new” 2050 oil and gas demand consensus that has emerged over the last year, (2). A systematic

discounted cash flow model, and (3). An assessment of the valuation insights that can be gleaned from 
calculating the emissions potential of undeveloped proved reserves for individual companies, as well as 
the metric’s potential risk management benefits in the current environment. 
 
Part 1: The Forecasters:  In stark contrast with the ongoing debate over the timing of peak oil demand, the current consensus on 
expected long-long term O&G demand (typically 2050) shifted markedly over the course of 2020-2021, 
settling into a remarkably uniform consensus. The International Energy Agency published its annual 
World Energy Outlook (WEO) in October of 2021, and for the first time in its history oil demand to 
2050 was forecast to decline under all examined scenarios (see Figure 1).5 
 
Figure 1 International Energy Agency “World Energy Outlook 2021” 
 
Source: IEA, Note: One Exajoule (EJ) is around 05 mb/d of oil 
 
 
5 It’s important to note that the vast majority of the current industry debate centers on whether “peak” demand occurs by 2030 or is 
forestalled until after that date. Debate about 2050 demand is less strenuous given the fundamental uncertainty around the next 
decade’s direction. 
 
 14
  
The IEA’s 3 scenarios are labeled STEPS, APS and NZE. Under the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), 
a situation where global average temperatures hit 2.6 oC above pre-industrial levels by 2100, oil demand 
levels off at 104 mb/d in the mid-2030s and then declines very slightly to 2050. Under the APS, or 
Announced Pledges Scenario, where global average temperature is held to 2.1 oC (but not achieving net 
zero, so the temperature trend does not stabilize) global oil demand peaks soon after 2025 at 97 mb/d 
and declines to 77 mb/d in 2050. In the Net Zero Emissions path (NZE), a narrow roadmap to 1.5 oC, 
oil demand falls to 72 mb/d in 2030 and to 24 mb/d by 2050. According to the IEA, under the NZE 
scenario, “By 2030, 60% of all passenger cars sold globally are electric, and no new ICE [Internal 
Combustion Engine] passenger cars are sold anywhere after 2035. Oil use as a petrochemical feedstock 
is the only area to see an increase in demand; in 2050, 55% of all oil consumed globally is for 
petrochemicals.”6 
 
Wood Mackenzie (WoodMac), a global energy consultancy, recently provided updates to its base case 
scenario for oil and gas demand (ETO) as well as its two more aggressive energy transition scenarios 
(AET-2 and AET-1.5). See Figure 2.

WoodMac Oil & Gas Demand 2050, AET-2 Versus Base Case

The ETO translates into a 2.5 °C to 2.7 °C pathway and represents WoodMac’s assessment of the “most 
likely outcome”, although the firm does not assign probabilities to its analysis7. It sees the current global 
economic recovery leading to energy-related CO 2 emissions rising over the next five years to a new high 
of 34 Bt in 2026, as well as the world’s continued reliance on fossil fuels. By 2050 hydrocarbons share of 
the global energy mix only falls to 70%, from 80% today. Oil demand plateaus and begins a slow decline 
in the mid-2030s while gas demand continues to increase into the 2040s, fueled primarily by Asian 
economic growth. Under the ETO oil demand sits around 110 mb/d by 2050. 
 
Given the experience of capital markets in 2021 and an “ever widening stakeholder community 
demanding clarity and action on decarbonization” WoodMac’s team generated forecasts for both 2 °C 
and 1.5 °C pathways. The results of the analysis show striking variance with the base case. In its AET-2 
  
7 https://www.woodmac.com/news/editorial/energy-transition-scenarios/ 
 
 16
scenario, oil demand falls by 70% to 35 mb/d by 2050 as electric vehicles and hydrogen disrupt road 
transportation, while recycling limits the feedstock demand for plastics. AET-1.5 is even more aggressive 
with the demand decline starting almost immediately, ultimately falling below 30 mb/d by 2050. 
WoodMac warns that “No oil company is preparing for the scale of decline envisioned in any of these 
scenarios [AET-2 or AET-1.5]”.8 The dramatic difference between the IEA’s APS and WoodMac’s AET-
2, with respect to 2050 oil demand, is primarily a feature of differing outcomes for petrochemical 
feedstock. The IEA sees a continued role for oil, while WoodMac forecasts oil’s displacement by 
hydrogen. 
 
Norwegian energy intelligence firm Rystad Energy presented its own forecast in 2021 with oil demand 
at 94 million bpd by 2030 and 38 million bpd by 2050 in its low case, and 51 million bpd in its “mean” 
case. Rystad expects faster growth of EVs than the IEA but disagrees that “behavioral change and 
biofuels will be able to remove 23 million bpd of demand by 2030.”9 However, the Rystad forecast is 
consonant with the IEA in that it sees lower oil demand by 2050 across all three of its scenarios (see 
Figure 3).

While many of the oil industry players themselves spend considerable effort on demand forecasting, only 
the largest public companies, with a global presence, tend to publish their world demand estimates. For 
instance, BP has been continuously publishing its “Statistical Review of World Energy” since 1952 and 
it has become a trusted source of data for the industry. Figure 4 shows the scenario analysis conducted 
by three large players: British Petroleum (NYSE: BP), Shell (NYSE: RDS.A) and Lukoil (LSE: LKOD).

Each company has different names for their scenarios, as well as slightly different metrics for demand, 
summarized below: 
 British Petroleum  – BP has named its three scenarios Rapid, Net Zero and Business-as-Usual 
(BAU)10. Net Zero corresponds to 95% reduction in global carbon emissions by 2050, in line 
with limiting temperature rise to 1.5 °C. The Rapid scenario assumes more targeted sector 
specific measures, reducing emissions by 70%, roughly in line with a 2 °C outcome. The 
consumption of liquid fuels falls under both scenarios, declining to 30 mb/d by 2050 under Net 
Zero and less than 55 mb/d under Rapid. The BAU scenario assumes little progress is made and 
2050 emissions stand at only 10% below 2018 levels. However, the consumption of liquid fuels 
in BAU is broadly flat at around 100 Mb/d for 20 years, before edging lower to around 95 Mb/d 
by 2050. It’s important to note that BP aggregates liquid fuels (oil, biofuels and other) so its 
numbers are slightly higher than oil-only comps.

2020.pdf

 Lukoil – The second largest Russian oil producer, Lukoil, released its own demand forecasts 
under three scenarios called, Evolution, Equilibrium and Transformation, roughly corresponding 
to limiting temperature rise to 2.6 °C, 2 °C and to 1.5 °C respectively11. Like BP, Lukoil aggregates 
liquid fuels and sees year 2050 demand at 99 mb/d, 74 mb/d and 45 mb/d under Evolution, 
Equilibrium and Transformation.  
 Shell – Transnational oil major Shell reports demand in terms of Exajoules (roughly 0.5 mb/d) 
and separates oil from other liquids in its forecast. Its three long horizon scenarios are called 
Islands, Waves and Sky 1.5, roughly corresponding to 2.5 °C, 2.3 °C and to 1.5 °C respectively12. 
The Islands path is characterized as “late and slow” progress, while Waves is dubbed “late but 
fast” and both envision a world that does not focus on a specific degree scenario outcome. Only 
Sky is explicitly aspirational. Under these scenarios Shell sees year 2050 oil demand at 192 ej/year, 
209 ej/year and 160 ej/year under Islands, Waves and Sky respectively13. This translates to 
roughly 86 mb/d, 94 mb/d and 72 mb/d. In this case, the 2.3 °C “Waves” scenario corresponds 
to higher 2050 oil demand than the Islands path because of a focus by countries coming out of 
the pandemic on wealth accumulation, over autonomy and self-sufficiency (an assumption 
possibly upended by recent geopolitical events). This initial orientation subsequently puts 
demand on a higher for longer pathway that notches up the end state condition. 
 
Taking the average of analyst estimates across the 6 providers above yields 95 mb/d, 64 mb/d and 40 
mb/d for the high, middle and low scenarios outlined by each forecaster respectively (see Figure 5). With 
2021 demand estimated to have been 96.4 mb/d, it’s striking that the consensus among the three best

known independent forecasters and an equal number of integrated oil companies shows average demand 
in 2050 below current demand, when global GDP will more than double over the same period.14 One 
caveat is that multiple forecasters’ “High” scenario is also their base case, and the various 1.5 °C 
projections are largely to indicate the degree of travel necessary to achieve more aspirational change. 
Finally, two prominent financial market data providers, Bloomberg and IHS Markit have estimates of 96 
mb/d and 86 mb/d respectively for their base case 2050 targets. It’s important to note that there are 
some forecasters that dispute the demand drop entirely, such as data intelligence firm Rapidan and 
supermajor Exxon (NYSE: XOM). Exxon sees 12% growth in liquids to 2050, rising to roughly 110 
mb/d, joining WoodMac on the high side of the current consensus15. Contrarian forecasters like Robert 
McNally at Rapidan are the first to admit that peak oil 2030 and a drop below 2021 demand have become 
“the new normal” forecast, dubbing the scenario “green decoupling” and highlighting the billions in 
capital currently allocated to support the shift. Rapidan’s contrary call is predicated on the fact that peak 
oil 2030 is almost entirely contingent on strong fuel efficiency standards being enforced in China and the 
U.S. with no backsliding (as fleet replacement to electric is a multi-decade process). A proposition he 
views with extreme skepticism.16 In addition, the U.S. Energy Information Agency has put forth its own 
estimates for 2050 oil and gas demand, which it takes pains to note are “not designed to be a prediction 
of what is most likely to happen”, but rather an extrapolation of current trends, whereby the reference 
scenario and all additional modeled scenarios show aggregate demand higher than today’s levels.17 
  
14 PwC forecast 2.6% per annum global GDP growth to 2050. 
15 This study only included integrated oil forecasts with three forecast scenarios. Exxon has provided a high forecast of 110 mb/d by 2050 
and a low forecast of 70 mb/d by 2040: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-mobil-climate-report-idUSKBN1FM2PP . Total Energy 
forecasts 45 mb/d by 2050 under its “Rupture” scenario and approximately 85 mb/d under its “Momentum” scenario. Factoring both 
“high” forecasts into the consensus results in a mean of 95 mb/d:

17 Indeed, consumption in the IEA's ""Reference case"" reaches approximately 125 million barrels per day (b/d) by 
2050, and consumption is highest in the ""High Economic Growth case"", where it reaches approximately 151 
million b/d of total liquid fuels in 2050

The important point to highlight, regardless of whether investors support the consensus18 or the minority 
contrarian scenario, is that the industry needs to prepare to be robust to the consensus outcome. 
Currently, the vast majority are wholly unprepared for a lower demand outcome. According to this 
current consensus, oil demand 30 years from now will be lower than current demand.19

However, expectations for a strong energy transition over the next three decades has not cooled a blazing 
hot runup for oil and gas securities since the pandemic low. Exploration and production companies, 
given that their valuation is almost solely based on reserves, without mid and downstream operations, 
  
18 Many industry insiders see no Paris-aligned pathway possble without industrial level carbon capture and storage, hydrogen 
replacement for petrochemical feedstock and rigorous CAFÉ standards.

scenario.

highlight this point well. Figure 6 shows the performance of the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & 
Production ETF (NYSE: XOP), with holdings of 61 U.S. E&P companies, against the performance of 
Brent crude and the S&P 500. As can be seen, XOP has gained 267% as Brent has climbed 175% and 
the overall S&P has gained 101%.20

long-long-term dynamics of the industry, are numerous:

 During the pandemic, economic activity hit a wall worldwide. This resulted in a massive oil 
demand drop and considerable oversupply, with some of the industry trading at multi-decade 
lows. Both the demand and supply factors have clearly reversed as economies have reopened. 
It’s estimated that the demand resurgence led to a significant drawdown in oil inventories and an 
estimated 2 mb/d undersupply over the course of 2021.21 In addition, potential demand 
destruction from higher prices has been less than comparable periods in history, implying higher 
current demand inelasticity and a greater probability of sustained high prices.22  
 
 The price of oil is expected to continue to climb in the near term as spare capacity, defined by 
the IEA as production that can be launched within 90 days and sustained over an extended 
period, continues to get squeezed. As most spare capacity is in the Gulf, with Saudi Arabia and 
the UAE accounting for the majority of the estimated 2.5 mb/d, this is very little cushion given 
geopolitical tensions and an estimated increase in demand of 4.2 mb/d expected in 2022. 
 
 The industry has experienced a long period of underinvestment (since 2015). It takes many years 
to get most projects onstream and any sustained period of underinvestment leads to supply 
mismatches over a multi-year horizon should demand conditions shift (as they have). JPM has 
observed for the last two years that despite developed world downshifts23, large developing 
economies like China and India should power a 1-2% annual increase in oil demand to 2030

companies shifted capital allocation strategies has redounded to the current moment and will 
likely persist in the short to medium term.24 
 
The history of the industry is rife with boom-bust periods and the ebbing power of OPEC+ to stabilize 
the business will likely lead to continued volatility.25 This coupled with profound shifts in future energy 
infrastructure equals tremendous uncertainty for the segment. With a 175% rise in the price of oil from 
the recent low the rising tide of oil demand has lifted many boats. However, with any appreciable price 
gain comes a commensurate rise in implied performance expectations. In the next section we try to 
unpack the expectations embedded in current E&P company prices. 
 
Part 2: Great Expectations:  In theory, valuing an oil and gas Exploration & Production (E&P) company is a straightforward affair, 
but often devilishly difficult in practice. Since an E&P’s raison d'être is to bring crude oil and natural gas 
out of the ground, a mainstay of valuation is ascribing some value to the hydrocarbon reserves that it 
accumulates. In contrast with net asset value assessments (NAV), a traditional discounted cash flow 
valuation (DCF) makes less sense. In a traditional DCF, a firm earns discrete cash flows for a designated 
period, hopefully in excess of the cost of capital, and then is ascribed some enduring value through a 
perpetuity. The possibility of enduring value only exists if reserves can be replaced economically for the 
entirety of an E&P’s future as a going concern. It's difficult to say with confidence that any E&P 
company can grow in perpetuity between 1-3% and certainly not in consideration of the “green 
decoupling” consensus described in the opening section of this report.

Historically, the E&P industry has struggled to generate returns on capital above the cost of capital for 
extended periods of time, as exemplified by performance over the last decade, shown in Figure 7 below. 
As can be seen, roughly half the time, investors were not adequately compensated for the risk of holding 
E&P companies (negative spread but positive ROC), or simply experienced pure value destruction 
(negative ROC). 
 
Important to note however, these returns came after an extraordinary decade of both positive returns 
and spreads for the overall industry. The fundamental nature of the business model, massive capital 
investments and long horizons for the realization of cash flows pose operating challenges that necessitate 
extreme capital discipline. A comprehensive study of the cash economics of the E&P business, utilizing 
cash flow return on investment (CFROI), a metric that approximates the cumulative IRR of all a 
company’s projects, concluded that the average E&P company returned 3% per annum since 195526, 
which reflects the challenging economics of the industry. 
 
Largely for this reason, the industry’s preferred metric for evaluating performance is return on capital 
employed (ROCE). A measure that does not consider taxes, thus boosting the numerator in the equation 
(EBIT versus NOPAT), and utilizes “capital employed” in the denominator, where the calculation is 
total assets minus all current liabilities, versus total assets minus “excess” cash minus non-interest-bearing 
current liabilities for the “invested capital” calculation. In general, more capital-intensive businesses favor 
the ROCE metric because it boosts reported returns (as can be seen in Figure 8).

Due to the factors described earlier in this report, 2022 is shaping up to be a banner year for E&P equity 
securities. The rise from the pandemic low has already been significant and the short to medium term 
outlook is promising, as oil prices continue to rise (amplified by geopolitical tensions). 
 
Despite the limitations of a DCF in valuing E&P companies, utilizing a reverse discounted cash flow 
model with no effective perpetuity value (ultralong time horizon) can be instructive in evaluating the 
expectations impounded in current prices28.

As can be seen from Figure 8, current market prices for the constituents29 of the XOP (S&P Oil & Gas 
Exploration & Production) are impounding many years of returns above the cost of capital. In fact, 80% 
of the index is implying greater than 50 years of value creating returns (ROIC above WACC)! To say the

least, the current expectations of more than 50 years of never-before-seen returns does not exactly square 
with the situation the industry currently faces. In sum, these frothy valuations are not only at odds with 
individual company return history (as seen in the rightmost column labeled “5 Year ROIC spread 
Actual”) as well as the historical industry returns outlined earlier, but the current valuations also defy the 
consensus that an energy transition could ultimately bring oil and gas demand below current levels by 
2050. See Appendix 1 for a complete discussion of GAP and reverse cash flow modelling. 
 
Despite this, for more senior observers of multiple oil and gas industry cycles, these arguably euphoric 
valuations are consistent with the historical boom-bust nature of the segment (where valuation extremes 
are not uncommon). Perhaps more importantly, current valuations imply a business-as-usual outlook 
amongst investors currently bidding up the names, without regard for the expected energy transition (i.e., 
nothing has really changed in how investors value these companies). For the reasons outlined previously 
(inventories, spare capacity and capital expenditures), this approach has been vindicated as a rational 
investment decision, at least in the short term. 
 
Some studies indicate that investors with longer expected holding periods are uncomfortable with the 
regulatory uncertainty and volatility around future demand and are simply opting out of investing in E&P 
companies altogether (over 800 firms representing $6 trillion in AUM have pursued an exclusionary 
approach to oil, gas and coal), leaving the remaining investors to price securities in line with historical 
norms30. This is a troubling situation for investors that want exposure to hydrocarbon names – especially

to firms actively navigating the expected transition -- but find an assessment of the associated risks 
challenging. 
 
At root, absent enormous advances in technology, the industry is facing an emissions problem, as 
consensus future demand scenarios envision a steep reduction in output due to the climate implications. 
The final section of this report will introduce a metric to help investors more finely tune the risks 
associated with the energy transition for the oil and gas E&P segment.  
 
Part 3: Material Risks  While public market equity investors may be proceeding in a business-as-usual fashion, E&P companies 
are experiencing clear financing stress related to the energy transition. Goldman Sachs estimates that the 
spread in the cost of capital of hydrocarbon versus renewable developments has widened by greater than 
ten percentage points over the last five years (Figure 9).

 30
When project IRRs, required returns on long duration, high-cost projects, increase significantly due to 
uncertainty around demand and the regulatory environment, fewer projects get funded, exploration 
budgets get cut and write-offs increase. This is validated by the expected 40% decline in the reinvestment 
ratio for all Oil & Gas in 2022 (based on current trends versus a 10-year average) and highlights an 
industry beset with poor regulatory clarity and lack of global coordination, in contrast with the electric 
utility industry, which has seen positive reinvestment ratios due to price support and more clear 
regulation31. A truism in the industry is that high oil prices are the best cure for high oil prices, as 
additional capacity ramps and the pendulum swings to oversupply. Over the last decade however, the 
number of climate-related shareholder resolutions has almost doubled and the percentage of investors 
voting in favor has almost tripled, to roughly 40%, with a targeted focus on energy producers rather than 
on final energy consumption. The prospect of continued shareholder pressure and sustained high 
financing costs may significantly delay what was in years past an almost certain setup for a price crash. 
This volatile backdrop shows no sign of abating, as few doubt the fact that a meaningful energy transition 
is on the horizon. Absent a global carbon tax regime or coordinated country-level emissions reductions, 
investors should gird for continued instability. 
 
This issue is particularly challenging for E&P companies, as undeveloped properties are major drivers of 
firm value. As can be seen in Figure 10, the probability of development for various categories of oil and 
gas reserves are not the same. As a firm moves down the chain of various commercial categories, the 
probability of development decreases. A reserve is only considered proven if it’s probable that a 
minimum of 90% is recoverable and economically profitable, with proved reserves divided into 
developed and undeveloped.

On a NAV basis, E&P companies typically trade well above the discounted value of their proved 
developed reserves, with the balance of the market value representing implied optionality on proved 
undeveloped properties (PUD), and possibly more distant P2, P3 according to some studies32. Since 
PUDs require future capital investments, they’re keenly sensitive to economic conditions. In a recent 
paper33, the National Bureau of Economic Research examined the relationship between firm value and 
proved reserves for 600 oil and gas firms in North America from 1999-2018 and found that proved 
undeveloped reserves growth and firm value were significantly negatively correlated (see Figure 10).

As can be seen from the data, the highlighted coefficient and p-value for the level of undeveloped 
reserves growth against firm value (Tobin’s Q) is significant and economically impactful (column 6 
highlighted), as a single standard deviation increase in growth of PUDs decreases firm value by 2.6% of 
the mean. To the left in Column 4, which represents the relation between firm value and the absolute 
level of reserves, rather than the growth of reserves, there is a high positive correlation with developed 
reserves and a negative correlation with undeveloped reserves, but both, arguably, are insignificant as the 
p-value (in parenthesis 0.136 and 0.065) are above the indicated 1% test level34. 
 
Given that reserves reporting is typically sub-categorized into oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids 
segments (NGL), a finer grained analysis of the relation between the emissions potential of these reserves

and firm value can aid in securities analysis.35 For the 30 E&P firms in this report, undeveloped proved 
reserves averaged 40% of total reserves on an annual basis over the last decade. While the growth of 
aggregate undeveloped reserves is important to valuation, the emissions potential and financing 
implications of the change in reserves mix needs to be disaggregated (as highlighted by LNG’s lower 
project IRR in Figure 9). Figure 11 below shows the relationship between the change in emissions 
potential of undeveloped proved reserves and Enterprise Value for the thirty E&P companies in Figure 
8 over the last five years. We plotted the change in undeveloped proved reserves over a given year, 
calculated the emissions potential of that change in reserves according to the hydrocarbon mix, and then 
performed a regression against Enterprise Value (firm value as dependent variable). 
 
  
35 XOM and others provide additional information on “bitumen” and “synthetics” as separate categories of reserves.

As can be seen, an even greater negative correlation exists (-0.54 coefficient, versus -0.23) between CO 2 
emissions and firm value. Again, it’s important to note that the growth in undeveloped proved reserves 
alone is impactful, but that growth does not necessarily give rise to a linear increase in emissions. The exact 
quantity of rise or fall in metric tons of CO 2 depends on the mix of proved undeveloped hydrocarbons 
that rise or fall (i.e., oil, natural gas and NGL). We utilized emissions factors formulated by the 
 
 35
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change36 for each type of hydrocarbon, a standard adopted around 
the world by governments and companies alike (including the U.S. Department of Energy and Exxon 
Mobil). Please see Appendix 2 for more information regarding the IPCC factors. 
 
In order to understand the impact of potential emissions from PUDs on equity performance we 
compared an equal-weighted portfolio of E&P company returns, utilizing the 30 companies outlined in 
this report, from 2017-2021. In the first scenario, we simply held all 30 companies for the entire period. 
As can be seen in Figure 12, this generated a 158% return. We then rebalanced the portfolio each year 
and removed the top quintile emitters (i.e., largest increase in potential emissions from undeveloped 
proved reserves), replacing them with the bottom quintile performers, which mostly consisted of firms 
that reduced emissions. 
 
Figure 12 Emissions-Based Portfolio Rebalancing

As can be seen, the portfolio return jumped dramatically to 208%, a move of 5000 basis points, or 32% 
improvement over the hold portfolio! An important observation from these data is that the growth or 
  
36 https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/EFDB/main.php 
 
 36
decline in PUDs and emissions, though highly correlated, sometimes diverged due to the relative mix of 
hydrocarbons. Here are some examples: 
 
 Talos Energy  (NYSE: TALO) a Gulf coast offshore E&P had a significant 334% rise in 
undeveloped proved reserves in Year 4 and potential emissions jumped an even greater 370% 
due to the oil content of those reserves, while Centennial Resource Development (Nasdaq: 
CDEV), a Permian operator, increased its PUDs in Year 2 by 6% while potential emissions only 
jumped 4% due to the focus on natural gas. 
 
 Murphy Oil  (NYSE: MUR), a U.S. operator with undeveloped reserves in Australia, Brazil, 
Brunei, Mexico and Vietnam decreased its PUDs in Year 2 by 14% but witnessed an emission 
decrease of 21% due to the write off of oil-rich properties. In contrast, in the same year, 
Marathon Oil (NYSE: MRO) cut undeveloped proved by 8% but only saw a 6% reduction in 
emissions potential due to the removal of less dense hydrocarbons from its portfolio. 
 
 Global independent E&P Hess (NYSE: HES) managed to cut its potential emissions from 
undeveloped proved reserves in half over the last decade, while simultaneously ramping up its 
total PUDs from 19% to 30% over the same period (undeveloped proved/total proved). The 
firm accomplished this feat by de-emphasizing oil and boosting natural gas and NGL reserves.  
 
Differences like these can result in small changes to the portfolio rebalancing, whereby the incremental 
return from the more fine-grained focus on emissions potential, rather than just undeveloped proved 
reserves, can allow investors to potentially earn incremental return (1000 basis points in our rebalancing, 
see Figure 12). With a relatively small pool of companies (30) the benefits to the rebalancing become 
more evident in the out years as removal of the largest emitters have a more pronounced effect. The  
 37
differences between the remaining companies narrow and the sorting more fully captures the differences 
outlined above (as seen in the Year 1 & 2 returns of the rebalancing). 
 
Conclusion:  Interestingly, over the last decade, virtually all the E&P companies seem to realize the potential negative 
effects of growing undeveloped proved reserves in the current environment, as only 3 companies saw a 
rise in the proportion of these reserves to total proved resources over the period -- and 2 of the 3 started 
from a base of zero (i.e., they started with no undeveloped proved reserves). The sole company to grow 
its proved undeveloped as a percentage of total proved over the period was Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM), 
and only by a small amount, from 27% to 33%. Notably, the company also reduced its potential emissions 
from these reserves 43% by halving oil and gas volumes and boosting NGLs. 
 
In addition to the potential portfolio implications outlined, there are individual security analysis benefits 
to utilizing a metric that tracks the potential emissions associated with undeveloped proved reserves, 
including the following: 
 
 Carbon Scoring  – As discussed earlier in this report, many hydrocarbon demand scenarios are 
now linked to emissions levels, where maximum allowable amounts are established in order to 
meet global warming targets. The implicit assumption is that countries, financiers and 
governments will increasingly adopt varying degrees of regulatory pressure and incentives to 
“enforce” these targets. Increasingly, investment services and portfolio software providers are 
scoring an individual company’s alignment with temperature benchmarks, sometimes referred to 
as “carbon scoring”  where the analysis contrasts the company’s stated targets against a 
benchmark. Carbon scoring then highlight how much reduction is still required of the company,  
 38
or if the firm is exceeding targets. Those that exceed targets are typically awarded higher scores. 
As an example, Bloomberg’s carbon scoring method has seen higher scores correlate with 
company outperformance.37 Calculating the emissions potential of undeveloped proved reserves 
would allow analysts to quantify a PUD threshold, or a level of undeveloped reserves that might 
affect the firm’s ability to meet or exceed its stated emissions goals. Putting this number in sharp 
relief would help investors understand the challenges and risks. 
 
 Precision  -- Increasingly analysts incorporating higher discount rates as a “blunt force” margin 
of safety when valuing some oil and gas investments. A few investors we spoke with are utilizing 
an additional 200-500 basis points on top of the calculated rate for more extreme physical and 
transition risks. In some circles, for upstream producers, industry standard oil and gas PV10 is 
now closer to PV15. This creates a significantly higher hurdle for the standard EV/PV10 
heuristic in evaluating investment opportunities. Understanding the trajectory of the emissions 
potential of PUDs for an individual security can allow analysts to accept their calculated rate 
without a blunt instrument margin of safety, but with a valuation adjustment to reflect the 
idiosyncratic risk of either growing or declining emissions potential of undeveloped proved assets 
for the valuation target. 
 
 Corporate Strategy – Clearly delineating emissions targets and the potential inherent in a firm’s 
undeveloped proved reserves can help a company understand where it fits in a country, regional, 
or global strategy. Having quantifiable metrics allows companies to manage what they measure, 
helping to explore the way in which carbon offsets or operational emissions reductions can 
  
37 https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/big-oil-learns-carbon-scores-matter-to-investors-green-insight  
 39
balance against future expected emissions. If these potential emissions can be aggregated at a 
market level, it will improve market efficiency with respect to the overall trajectory of emissions 
in coming years, as well as the context of an individual company’s efforts within that overall path. 
 
Numerous institutional investor surveys over the last year have indicated that investors understand the 
potential materiality of climate change in the valuation of companies. In the Robeco 2021 Global Climate 
Survey of the 300 largest institutional investors, with a total of $23.4 trillion in assets under management, 
71% of respondents asserted that climate change was either a “significant factor” or “at the center” of 
investment policy (47% and 26% respectively).38 In addition, in the Greenwich 2021 survey of 101 
investors with greater than $3B in assets, it was reported that 58% of respondents actively incorporated 
climate change considerations into their investment process, with approximately 75% doing so because 
the practice “improves risk-adjusted returns”.39 
 
Despite majorities in both surveys acknowledging the importance of climate risk, a significant number 
cited the need for more reliable data, models and disclosures to effectively evaluate the risks. The lack of 
perceived in-house expertise was a strong limiting factor (40% of investors in the Greenwich survey), as 
many investors didn’t feel they had the requisite expertise to isolate the elements that impacted firm 
value. Of the respondents in the Greenwich survey roughly 31% utilized carbon emissions data as a 
factor in their internal analysis40, leaving considerable room for more efficient pricing of this factor as 
adoption increases. As demonstrated in this report, under the right circumstances, investors can use these 
data to inform their analysis and generate potentially superior returns.

Bad DCF models are misleading. We won’t argue that, but DCF analysis remains extremely helpful when 
used to reverse engineer what companies must do to justify their stock price, aka “expectations 
investing”. The right way to use DCF models is not to try to predict the future, but to quantify the future 
that the stock price is predicting. 
  
Our DCF starts with the principle that stocks can be valued in the same way as bonds. As shown in 
Figure 1, the drivers of future cash flow between the two types of securities are analogous. The only 
difference is that the future cash flows for bonds are contractually determined while the future cash flows 
for stocks are undetermined. However, if one accepts the premise that the value of an asset equals the 
present value of future cash flows, then it follows that reverse DCF models can quantify the future cash 
flows required to justify stock prices. 
 
Appendix Figure 1: The Basic Valuation Recipe: Same for Stocks and Bonds  
 
 
In Figure 2, we categorize the drivers of a stock’s implied future cash flows into more intuitive terms. 
 
  
41 https://www.newconstructs.com/how-new-constructs-discounted-cash-flow-model-works/ 
 
 41
Appendix Figure 2: Simpler Terms for Measuring Cash Flows  
 
 
We think it is easier to think about the future cash flows implied by stocks prices in these terms because 
they capture the core drivers of business success:  Revenue Growth: how fast will the business grow? 
ROIC – WACC: how profitable with the business be? Growth Appreciation Period (GAP): for how long 
will the business grow profits? In Figure 3, we match the more intuitive drivers for equity cash flows 
with the drivers of bonds. With this understanding, we can focus on using our reverse DCF to get the 
answers to these questions from Mr. Market. 
 
Appendix Figure 3: The New Constructs Valuation Recipe: Same for Stocks and Bonds  
 
 
Most of the time, we forecast Revenue Growth and ROIC – WACC over a very long forecast horizon, 
not just five or 10 years (more details below). Then, we solve for the Growth Appreciation Period (GAP) 
needed for the DCF model to produce a stock price equal to the current stock price. In other words, we 
 
 42
provide forecasts for three of the four variables in the equation and solve for the 4th variable. Our DCF 
models do not rely on static forecast horizons such as five or ten years as do traditional DCF models. 
Our models are dynamic, which means we calculate values for the stock based on multiple forecast 
horizons. The key to this approach is a terminal value in each forecast horizon that assumes zero growth 
(e.g., NOPAT/WACC not WACC-g) after the forecast horizon. Rather than trying to capture all the 
future growth in cash flows in a static time frame (e.g., five years), our models calculate the value 
attributable to shareholders over 100 forecast periods.42

Appendix II: IPCC Emissions Factors Background                                                                                                                         
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a body composed of sovereign nations 
assembled under United Nations auspices that provides the world with objective, scientific information 
relevant to understanding the risk of human-induced climate change, as well as its natural, political, and 
economic impacts and possible response options.  
In its Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories published in 200643, the IPCC included 
“Default CO 2 Emissions Factors for Combustion” (DEFC, acronym ours, see Appendix Figure 4). 
The carbon content of different fossil fuels and the reserves from which they originate can vary 
considerably both among and within primary fuel types on a per mass or per volume basis. However, 
the IPCC’s measurement of effective CO 2 emissions of fuels upon combustion as reflected in the 
DEFC avoids this complication.  
Fossil fuel combustion processes are optimized to derive the maximum amount of energy per unit of 
fuel consumed, which delivers the maximum amount of CO 2. Efficient fuel combustion ensures 
oxidation of the maximum amount of carbon available in the fuel. CO 2 emission factors for fuel 
combustion are therefore relatively insensitive to the combustion process itself and hence are primarily 
dependent exclusively on the carbon content of the fuel.  
For these reasons and due to the global credibility of the IPCC, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (U.S. EPA) uses the DEFC in its the basis for the Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas 
  
43 https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/   
 44
Inventories44 used by the U.S. EPA Center for Corporate Climate Leadership, which has in turn been 
used by ExxonMobil45 and other companies to calculate their Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions46. 
In June 2016, the oil industry sustainability group IPIECA published “Estimating petroleum industry 
value chain (Scope 3) greenhouse gas emissions. Overview of methodologies47.” The document draws 
on the WRI and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) GHG Protocol 
Scope 3 Standard to outline approaches used by the oil and gas industry to estimate scope 3 emissions. 
Exxon drew on the IPIECA methodology to report its Scope 3 emissions noted earlier48.  The 
document is also available on the website of the American Petroleum Institute (API)49. 
The IPCC effective CO 2 emission factors are also the reference coefficients for ISO Standard 1406450 
on the quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. These are also the metric used in the 
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Scope 3 disclosure guidance for oil companies51.

Re: Request for Comment on Climate Change Disclosures 
 
 
Dear Chair Gensler and Commissioners, 
 
We are writing to share research that responds to the request for comment on Climate Disclosure 
made on March 15, 20211. The following comment outlines a proposal to amend the SEC’s 2010 
Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Rule (as it relates to Item 1202 of Regulation S-K)2 to 
require oil and gas reserves disclosures that the effective CO 2 emissions that they represent in a 
scientifically valid and user-friendly manner. The comment seeks to answer the following questions 
put forth in the March 15, 2021 request: 
 
1. What information related to climate risks can be quantified and measured?  How are markets 
currently using quantified information? Are there specific metrics on which all registrants 
should report (such as, for example, scopes 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions, and 
greenhouse gas reduction goals)? What quantified and measured information or metrics 
should be disclosed because it may be material to an investment or voting decision? 
 
2. Do climate change related impacts affect the cost of capital, and if so, how and in what ways? 
How have registrants or investors analyzed risks and costs associated with climate change? 
What are registrants doing internally to evaluate or project climate scenarios, and what 
information from or about such internal evaluations should be disclosed to investors to inform 
investment and voting decisions? How does the absence or presence of robust carbon markets 
impact firms’ analysis of the risks and costs associated with climate change? 
 
4. What are the advantages and disadvantages of establishing different climate change reporting 
standards for different industries, such as the financial sector, oil and gas, transportation, etc.? 
How should any such industry-focused standards be developed and implemented? 
 
5. What are the advantages and disadvantages of rules that incorporate or draw on existing 
frameworks, such as, for example, those developed by the Task Force on Climate-Related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and 
the Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB)? Are there any specific frameworks that the 
Commission should consider? If so, which frameworks and why?

2 https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2008/33-8995.pdf 
Page 2 of 30  
  
7. What is the best approach for requiring climate-related disclosures? For example, should any 
such disclosures be incorporated into existing rules such as Regulation S-K or Regulation S-
X, or should a new regulation devoted entirely to climate risks, opportunities, and impacts be 
promulgated? Should any such disclosures be filed with or furnished to the Commission?    
 
The following is an outline of our proposal: 
 
 
Emissions Data Use in Assessing Climate Risk in Securities Analysis Oil and gas greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data is both quantifiable and readily accessible to 
investors. For example, more than 70 metrics and targets aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures (TCFD) can be accessed on a Bloomberg Terminal3. These metrics consist of 
governance and operations data, which includes Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions totals by year. 
See Figure 1 below.  
 
Figure 1 GHG Emissions Data Available on Bloomberg Terminal 
 
Source: Bloomberg 
 
Bloomberg Terminal users can also evaluate potential future capital expenditures at risk in the oil and 
gas industry using the 2D Scenario Analysis Tool, created by Carbon Tracker and powered by Rystad 
Energy’s asset-level data4. The model can evaluate scenarios reported by companies themselves, or can 
be used to identify opportunities in companies already transitioning to low-carbon strategies (see Figure 
2).

Market participants with access to the Bloomberg Terminal and Rystad may use these information 
tools to inform their allocations and proxy votes, but both are costly, with a Bloomberg and Rystad 
subscription priced at roughly $25,000 and $15,000 per year, respectively. While Bloomberg has been 
providing emissions data since 2017, many market participants are making investment decisions about 
oil and gas securities without this critical information. In addition, at a recent investor event, 
Bloomberg acknowledged that the quality, accuracy and uniformity of emissions-related disclosures 
could all use improvement in order to better serve investors and price risks accurately5. 
 
An additional tool utilized by market participants for assessing climate risk is software that analyzes 
the underlying constituents of an investor’s portfolio to assess both the physical and transition risks 
associated with climate change. Some prominent providers of these tools are listed in Figure 3 below6: 
 
 5 Emerging Markets Investors Alliance Webinar: “Pricing Climate Risks” June 3, 2021 
6 WK Associates counted over two dozen software packages currently on the market.

These software tools rely on accurate and complete data, reported by companies and 3rd party 
providers across all emissions scopes, to successfully price potential risks. In discussions with 
providers, accurate Scope 3 data from the oil and gas industry was observed to perform a valuable 
“check” on aggregate emissions totals, given the downstream effect of refined petroleum products on 
all transportation activity. 
 
Scenario analysis, such as the services offered for Bloomberg Terminal users and select software 
providers, requires the use of Scope 3 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions data. The GHG emissions 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 concept was introduced in 2001 by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and World 
Business Council for Sustainable Development as part of their Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard7. The objective of the emissions scopes was to create a method 
for companies to measure and report the emissions associated with their businesses based on 
proximity to core operations.  
 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG Emissions 
Scope 1 emissions originate from operations that are directly owned and controlled by a company. 
Scope 2 apply to indirect operational emissions. In the oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) 
segment operational emissions include those from the use of company vehicles and equipment to 
 
7 https://ghgprotocol.org/corporate-standard 
 
Page 5 of 30  
 emissions caused by methane leakage and gas flaring. Scope 2 emissions are one step beyond a 
company’s immediate control, such as carbon pollution related to the electricity and heat the company 
purchases from utilities. These emissions can be mitigated by sourcing inputs from a power grid with 
lower carbon intensity, or through on-site renewables.  
 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction efforts have been the focus of the oil and gas sector for more than 
a decade8. While admirable, Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions only represent about 10 percent of an 
average E&P’s carbon footprint9. Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions also lack standardization, which 
makes comparability a challenge10.  
 
Scope 3 GHG Emissions Scope 3 emissions are those generated from value chain activities that are not accounted for and 
reported in the company’s Scope 1 and 2 corporate inventories11. Put differently, a company’s Scope 
3 carbon emissions include everything beyond its direct operations and electricity use, including 
supply-chain operations and end-product usage by customers12. In many sectors the emissions that 
originate from a company’s corporate value chain are difficult to ascertain and quantify. However, in 
the energy sector, especially in oil, gas and coal production, Scope 3 emissions are comprised 
primarily of the expected GHG emissions attributable to a company’s reserves. As such, they fall into 
Category 11 or the “use of sold products” classification of Scope 3 inventories, as indicated in the 
calculation guidance provided by the GHG Protocol13.  
 
Scope 3 emissions can represent the largest source of emissions for companies and present the most 
significant opportunities to influence GHG reductions. For instance, Scope 3 emissions account for 
roughly 70-90% of lifecycle emission from oil products and 60-85% of those from natural gas, 
according to the IEA (International Energy Agency)14. Further, a July 2020 study of the MSCI ACWI 
Investable Market Index, which includes roughly 99% of the global equity market, found that the  Scope 
3 emissions of the integrated oil and gas industry are more than six times the level of its Scope 1 and 2 
emissions15. In addition, the Scope 3 emissions of the energy sector far outpace those of any other 
Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) category, especially with respect to use of products sold 
(See figure 4).

The fossil fuel sector’s Scope 3 emissions are also a key input for the financial service industry’s 
“financed emissions” calculation. In a 2020 study, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) found that 
almost all financial institutions’ climate impact and risks are driven by the fossil fuel exploration and 
production activities they finance. The CDP study of 85 financial institutions with $27 trillion in 
assets under management found that their financed emissions were more than 700 times greater than 
their own operational emissions16.  
 
In recognition of the very significant GHG emissions reduction opportunity represented by Scope 3 
emissions, energy companies have improved their disclosure and goal-setting against this metric. Figure 
5 features information compiled by Reuters in January 2021 that summarizes the public reduction 
targets for Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions by nine major integrated oil and gas companies.

Scope 3 Emissions and Access to Capital 
Access to capital is a significant reason for the urgency with which major energy companies have set 
GHG emissions reduction targets. In a February 2021 letter to its clients, Blackrock, the world’s 
largest asset manager with $8 trillion in assets under management, outlined various ways that GHG 
emissions disclosures influence its investment decision-making and proxy voting18. These include 
creating a watch list of companies with significant climate-related risk. In the case these companies do 
not take strong steps toward aligning their business plans -- including their Scope 3 emissions 
disclosure and reduction -- with a 2ºC climate mitigation strategy the company will vote against

NOTE: 1) Scope 1 refers to emissions from a company's direct operations, such as a diesel 
generator on an offshore platform 
      2) Scope 2 are emissions from the power a company uses for its operations, such as 
gas-powered electricity purchased 
      3) Scope 3 includes emissions from products sold, such as gasoline sold at petrol 
stations or jet fuel sold to an airline

 management on climate-related proxy proposals and potentially exit holdings based on a 
determination that they would present a risk to clients’ returns19. 
 
Another demonstration of the use of Scope 3 emission by investors is the work of the Transition 
Pathway Initiative (TPI). The Transition Pathway Initiative is an asset-owner led collaborative which 
assesses companies' preparedness for the transition to a low carbon economy20.  
 
In coordination with the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the 
London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), TPI publishes data based on a variety of 
disclosures including Scope 3 emissions21. These are intended to help investors assess the alignment 
of their portfolios with the goals of the Paris Agreement . A total of 104 investment organizations, 
with more than $26 trillion in assets under management, have committed to using TPI data to inform 
their investment research and aid in company engagement. TPI has published case studies on how the 
Dutch asset manager Robeco, UK-based Brunel Pension Partnership, private equity firm PineBridge 
Investments, Swedish insurance company Länsförsäkringar AB, the UK’s Universities 
Superannuation Scheme (USS), and the Church of England Pensions Board all use TPI data, including 
Scope 3 emissions, in both investment decision-making and proxy voting22.  
 
It is worth noting that a November 2020 TPI report funded by Aberdeen Standard Investments, BNP 
Paribas Asset Management, Legal & General Investment Management, Robeco, and Neuberger 
Berman found that the energy sector remains slow in implementing new operational and strategic 
carbon management practices23. The 2020 assessment of the energy sector, comprising 163 companies 
in coal mining, electricity, and oil and gas production and distribution, used Scope 3 emissions data to 
create carbon performance metrics showing that only 5 of the 53 oil and gas companies reviewed had 
performance and policy indicators aligned with the Paris Pledges. And no oil and gas producer was 
aligned with 2°C warming targets outlined by the United Nations24.  
 
The SEC itself has indicated its understanding of the importance of Scope 3 disclosures in its very 
recent treatment of shareholder proposals. In March 2021, the SEC denied ConocoPhillips’ and 
Occidental’s requests to exclude Scope 3 disclosure shareholder proposals from their proxy 
materials25.  
 
 
How to Calculate Oil and Gas Scope 3 Emissions Given its consequence in assessing climate risk in the energy sector, our research strongly points to 
the need for the broad availability of Scope 3 emissions data. While access to comprehensive Scope 3 
emissions data is limited, an adjustment of the SEC’s 2010 Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting 
Rule26 (specifically regarding Item 1202 of Regulation S-K), including the application of 
internationally respected scientific information to routinely reported reserves information, would 
allow a much broader group of market participants to access these material data and enhance the 
market’s efficiency in pricing the risks of climate change overall. 
 
Scope 3 emissions calculation and reporting for companies with fossil fuel reserves can take several 
forms. For example, the approach described by the World Resources Institute (WRI) in its paper A 
Recommended Methodology for Estimating and Reporting the Potential Greenhouse Gas Emissions 
from Fossil Fuel Reserves , is a comprehensive translation of fossil fuel reserves into expected CO 2 
emissions as well as detailed accounting for Categories 1, 2, 3 and 5 emissions, as noted in Figure 4.

Methodology for Estimating the Potential Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Fossil Fuel Reserves 
In 2016, WRI published a working paper titled A Recommended Methodology for Estimating and 
Reporting the Potential Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Fossil Fuel Reserves27, as supplemental 
guidance to the GHG Protocol . This working paper outlines a recommended methodology corporate 
accounting and disclosure of potential CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel producers’ reserves or Scope 3 
emissions for companies with fossil fuel reserves. 
 
As noted in the working paper, the first draft of this methodology was prepared based on desk 
research and consultations with exchange regulators and reserves auditing firms. A second draft was 
developed based on feedback from 15 select experts, as well as an open comment period during which 
20 submissions were received. The experts were drawn from reserves auditing firms, the SEC, 
companies including Shell and Equinor, industry associations including IPIECA (International 
Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association), voluntary reporting programs, 
nongovernmental organizations, and academia. As such, it is the most comprehensive and thoroughly 
reviewed methodology for calculating GHG emissions that we have come across. 
 
The methodology begins with the recommended use of the Petroleum Resource Management System 
(PRMS) (for oil and gas) and the Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards 
(CRIRSCO) template (for coal), or consistent national codes, to quantify the size of fossil fuel 
reserves. It goes on to suggest inclusion of other emissions considerations, such as the amounts of 
fossil fuels used as fuel in internal operations, those lost through flaring, venting, and fugitive 
activities or employed in CO 2 EOR processes, and those lost through CH4 (methane) leakage.  
 
The WRI methodology also recommends disclosure of emissions in terms of the proven and probable 
reserves from which they originate and suggests that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC)28 Tier 1 emissions factors be used to calculate potential GHGs emissions and CO 2 equivalents. 
The WRI guidance also suggests the resulting CO 2 emissions factors from proven and probably fossil 
fuels reserves be reported in similar fashion to Figure 6. 
 
 27 https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/WRI16_WorkingPaper_FF.pdf  
28 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) 
and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 1988. It was later endorsed by the United Nations General 
Assembly through Resolution 43/53. The IPCC was the winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize and has been recognized by the 
world’s leading authority by organizations such as the Royal Society, Britain's most prestigious scientific institute. Its main 
objective is to assess scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to the understanding of human induced 
climate change, potential impacts of climate change and options for mitigation and adaptation. Its research is done by a group 
of leading scientists from industry (including representatives from ExxonMobil and other companies), government and civil 
society. Summaries of this work are subject to line-by-line approval by all 120 participating governments. Typically this involves 
the governments of more than 120 countries.[ The IPCC has completed four assessment reports, developed methodology 
guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories, special reports and technical papers. The IPCC National Greenhouse Gas 
Inventories Programme was managed from 1991 by the IPCC WG I in close collaboration with the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Energy Agency (IEA). 
 
Data from the IPCC 2014 climate assetment report show that the major sources of emissions have been coal (34%), oil (25%), 
gas (10%), cement (2%) and land-use (29%)

The WRI reporting methodology translates proven and probably fossil fuel reserves into expected 
CO2 emissions, while adding additional CO 2 equivalents that arise from activities such as venting and 
other fugitive emissions. The translation of proven and probable reserves to expected CO 2 emissions 
is made possible through the application of the IPCC’s effective CO 2 emission factors.  
 
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an intergovernmental body of the United 
Nations dedicated to providing the world with objective, scientific information relevant to 
understanding the scientific basis of the risk of human-induced climate change. In addition, the IPCC 
examines the physical, political, and economic impacts of climate change, and possible response 
options.  
 
In its Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories published in 200629, the IPCC included 
“Default CO 2 Emissions Factors for Combustion” (see Figure 7). The carbon content of different 
fossil fuels and the reserves from which they originate can vary considerably, both among and within 
primary fuel types on a per mass or per volume basis. However, the IPCC’s measurement of effective 
CO2 emissions of fuels upon combustion as reflected in the Default CO 2 Emissions Factors for 
Combustion avoids this complication.  
 
 
29 https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/  
Page 11 of 30  
 Fossil fuel combustion processes are optimized to derive the maximum amount of energy per unit of 
fuel consumed, which delivers the maximum amount of CO 2. Efficient fuel combustion ensures 
oxidation of the maximum amount of carbon available in the fuel. CO 2 emission factors for fuel 
combustion are therefore relatively insensitive to the combustion process itself and are solely 
dependent on the carbon content of the fuel.  
 
For these reasons, as well as the global credibility of the IPCC, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (U.S. EPA) uses the Default CO2 Emissions Factors for Combustion in its calculation of 
Emission Factors for Greenhouse Gas Inventories30. This calculation is used by the U.S. EPA Center 
for Corporate Climate Leadership, which has in turned been used by ExxonMobil31 and other 
companies to calculate their Scope 3 GHG emissions32. 
 
In June 2016, the oil industry sustainability group IPIECA published “Estimating petroleum industry 
value chain (Scope 3) greenhouse gas emissions. Overview of methodologies33.” The document draws 
on the WRI and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) GHG Protocol 
Scope 3 Standard to outline approaches used by the oil and gas industry to determine company’s 
Scope 3 emissions. Exxon drew on the IPIECA methodology to report its Scope 3 emissions noted 
earlier34.  The document is also available on the website of the American Petroleum Institute (API)35. 
 
The IPCC effective CO 2 emission factors are also the reference coefficients for ISO Standard 1406436 
on the quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, these are also the metric 
used in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) Scope 3 disclosure guidance for oil companies37.

Oil and Gas Reserves and Effective CO 2 Emissions Data 
Fossil fuel reserves data is the other half of the effective CO 2 emissions calculation. Oil and gas 
reserves reporting guidance exists in Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 
1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as Industry Guide 2. Accounting Standards 
Codification (ASC) 93238 provides the specifics for the calculation of reserves required for disclosure.  
 
Fossil Fuel Reserves Calculation The general term ‘reserves’ typically refers to oil and gas and mineral resources that are commercially 
viable and are further broken down into the sub-categories of proved (P1), probable (P2) and possible 
(P3). Environmental and social considerations are specifically addressed in determining the 
commercial viability of a reserve under the Petroleum Resource Management System (PRMS) 
developed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (2007).  
 
Under the PRMS, new extraction projects can generally be categorized as reserves, provided that the 
projects will start within five years. Also, if reserves were deemed to be subject to a combustion 
constraint, they should be re-classified as contingent resources (that is, contingent on their ability to 
 38https://www.fasb.org/cs/BlobServer?blobcol=urldata&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobkey=id&blobwhere=1175820075990&blobh
eader=application/pdf  
https://www.sprioilgas.com/blog/sec-oil-and-gas-reserve-reporting-an-in-depth-explanation  
Page 13 of 30  
 be utilized). Contingent resources are those discovered, but not commercially viable, and otherwise 
reflect the same profile of probabilities that apply to “normal” reserves and prospects. 
 
The Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (CRIRSCO) template has 
similarities to the PRMS system. The CRIRSCO template includes social and environmental aspects 
in its ‘Modifying Factors’, where consideration of mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, 
environmental, social and governmental factors are all determinative if a measured or inferred 
resource can be classified as a reserve. First, all companies falling under a reporting code are required 
to consider environmental factors in their justification of whether or not reserves can be extracted. 
Second, the “competent person” is reminded that consideration of environmental factors should form 
part of their professional duty to the public.  
 
Proved and probable mineral reserves (CRIRSCO template) have the same approximate level of 
associated confidence as proved and probable petroleum reserves. PRMS distinguishes between 
conventional and unconventional resources, while CRISCO does not. Broadly speaking, 
unconventional resources are not influenced by the normal hydraulic effects of a reservoir and require 
enhanced extraction techniques. Unconventional resources include extra-heavy oil, bitumen, tight gas, 
coal bed methane, shale gas, oil shale, and gas hydrates. 
 
Many firms have reserve committees that oversee resource reporting. Any of the senior management 
sign-offs, such as those required under the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002), also require assurance 
that the evaluator has followed appropriate due diligence.  
 
Under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) there are no requirements for the reporting 
of reserves and resources for oil, gas or mining operations. Under US GAAP (Generally Accepted 
Accounting Principles) it is only oil and gas firms that must disclose proven reserves information, but 
not probable reserves (in contrast with Canada). However, many SEC-registered issuers disclosure 
probable reserves information. These gaps in disclosure deny many market participants the 
information necessary to make optimal investment decisions, but this shortcoming is beyond the 
scope of this document.  
 
Use of Oil and Gas Reserves Data in Securities Analysis The SEC requires oil and gas reserves disclosure because these data play a very significant role in the 
proper assessment of a security’s risk exposure. Oil and gas reserves are the most important assets of 
any oil and gas company and reserves represent most of the value of an exploration and production 
company39. In fact, IHS Energy analysis has found that about 80 percent of the value of most publicly 
traded oil and gas companies is based on their proved reserves40. 
 
Among other things, securities analysts use reserves as the basis for calculating unit-of-production 
depreciation, depletion and amortization rates, impairment testing and decommissioning cost 
estimates. For example, a decrease in estimated proved reserves would increase depreciation and 
depletion and amortization expenses, while an increase in reserves would reduce each of these. In 
addition, the timing of reserves depletion may impact the provision for decommissioning cost 
estimates.  
 
Trends in fossil fuel reserves data may also indicate downside risk for specific securities. For 
example, recent data published by researchers at Simon Fraser University show that the growth of 
these reserves has a negative effect on firm value41. These conclusions were reached by analyzing a 
sample of 679 North American oil and gas firms for the period 1999 to 2018. The study’s evidence is 
consistent with markets penalizing future investment in undeveloped reserves growth due to climate 
policy risk.

SEC’s 2010 Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Rule 
In 2010, the SEC published a rule called the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting42,  which was 
intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and 
gas reserves to aid valuation. The rule’s amendments were designed to update the oil and gas 
disclosure requirements to align them with then current practices and changes in technology. 
 
Among those changes was the requirement to disclose proven and probable reserves based on their 
final product, including those from ""non-traditional"" sources. In this case, non-traditional resources 
include bitumen, shale and coalbed methane. The SEC's guidance was that these disclosures could be 
made in tables such as Figure 8 with ""Synthetic Oil"" and ""Synthetic Gas"" used as a catchall for 
unconventional resources (such as oil sands, shale and coalbed methane).  
 
The ability to book more proved undeveloped reserves under the Modernization of Oil and Gas 
Reporting rule, along with the opportunity to recognize large proved undeveloped reserves in 
unconventional resource plays, means that undeveloped reserves had greater impact on a company’s 
financial results and resulting valuation. Consequently, the Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting 
rule has had the effect of capitalizing additional high carbon reserves from ""non-traditional"" sources.  
This boosted the valuation of oil and gas companies that went on to provide more high carbon fuels to 
the market.  
  
Providing reserves to CO 2 emissions data in Section 13 disclosures would help mitigate the unintended 
consequences of the 2010 rule. Disclosing oil and gas reserves in terms of the CO 2 emission they 
represent would allow market participants to accurately price and compare the climate risks of different 
issuers. In fact, the Commission indicated such differentiation had applications to investment analysis 
in its 2010 rule when it said, “We believe that with this separate disclosure, investors will be able to 
identify resources in projects that produce synthetic oil or gas that may be more sensitive to economic 
conditions from other resources43.” Today a significant portion of that sensitivity is to the economic 
conditions created by the climate risk associated with high carbon resources.

In its Form 10-K filing made for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, ExxonMobil satisfied the 
oil and gas reserves disclosure requirement with the table below (Figure 9)44. The data is confined to 
developed and undeveloped proven reserves. Reserves information is typically presented at a summary 
level by country or continent, as shown in ExxonMobil’s table.

Proposed Changes to the 2010 Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Rule 
Given the credibility of the IPCC effective CO 2 emissions factors and the importance of accurate 
reserves data in securities analysis, we suggest that they be utilized to create a quantifiable and 
measurable indication of the future CO 2 emissions represented by proven and probable reserves 
reported in annual disclosures included in 10-K statements.  
 
GHG emissions reporting is essential to investors’ understanding of material climate risk 
considerations. Scope 3 emissions data for oil and gas companies would both advance the objectives 
of the SEC’s 2010 Interpretive Guidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change and update 
its oil and gas reserves disclosure guidance to reflect the changing economics and related risks of 
fossil fuels development and marketing.  
 
In February 2021, a worldwide database of fossil fuel reserves called the Global Registry of Fossil 
Fuels was launched by the Carbon Tracker Initiative and Global Energy Monitor45. The organizations 
note that existing databases on fossil fuel reserves and production lack detail, are proprietary, or are 
solely for industry use. If the SEC were to mandate more accurate accounting of fossil fuel reserves 
and their associated effective CO 2 emissions, it also would be a significant contribution to efforts to 
understand the climate impact of future energy consumption globally. 
 
Format of Proposed Effective CO2 Emission Disclosure Figure 10 (below) reflects a merging of ExxonMobil’s actual reserves disclosures in its 2020 10-K 
and the format for effective CO 2 emissions disclosures outlined above. The calculation of the effective 
CO2 emissions of proven and probable oil and gas reserves involves the multiplication of the oil 
equivalent of each type of a company’s reserves by the corresponding IPCC effective CO 2 emission 
factor.

 In Figure 10 and in ExxonMobil’s FY2020 10-K, natural gas reserves are converted to an oil-
equivalent basis at six billion cubic feet per one million barrels. As noted in the WRI methodology, 
separate calculations should be made for proven and probable reserves.

 Limiting Emissions Estimates to Sales Quantities of Oil and Gas Reserves 
Exhaustive calculations of oil and gas Scope 3 emissions may require looking beyond the sales 
quantities reported in reserves estimates, as illustrated in the proposed methodology. However, the 
purpose of this calculation is to determine the potential economic impact of the effective CO 2 
emissions represented by proven and probable fossil reserves. If the purpose were to calculate of the 
contribution of oil and gas industry emissions to the total amount of greenhouse gases present in the 
atmosphere, a more comprehensive approach would be necessary. 
 
Distinctions Between Combusted and Manufactured Reserves A portion of sales quantities of fossil fuel reserves are not combusted, but used in the manufacture of 
products, such as petrochemicals, asphalts, lubricants, waxes and pigments. However, under the 
PRMS, oil and gas quantities are defined in terms of sales quantities measured at the reference point, 
which is typically the point of sale to third parties, or where custody is transferred to the producing 
entity’s downstream operations46. Our method also assumes this will be the point at which carbon 
pricing, through a tax or similar means, will be assessed. In this circumstance, the economic impact of 
combusted reserves and those used in manufacturing is equivalent and we believe there is no need to 
account for the storage of carbon in non-fuel products.  
 
Adjustment of Reserve Types in 2010 Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Rule The Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting Rule of 2010 changed reserves reporting categories 
from the type of each reserve to its end product. This change blurs the line between upstream and 
downstream oil and gas operations that is often an important consideration for investors. It also 
complicates the attribution of reserves to the IPCC effective CO 2 emissions factors that would help 
investor understand the emission they may create.  
 
To assist investors in understanding the economic considerations specific to each reserve type and to 
accommodate the accurate attribution of the effective CO 2 emissions, the reserve types would have to 
be changed to a manner consistent with the “Default CO 2 Emissions Factors for Combustion” of the 
IPCC’s Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories47. For example, the Modernization of Oil 
and Gas Reporting Rule allows for disclosure of reserves in a catch-all category called “Synthetic 
Oil”, which does not correspond directly to an individual category in the IPCC’s Guidelines for 
National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. 
 
In some cases, PRMS guidelines may not allow for reserves categorization that is perfectly consistent 
with the IPCC categories. For instance, under PRMS, if natural gas is sold wet (i.e., without the 
removal of NGLs), then the NGLs are included in the reserve estimate for natural gas. In such cases, 
and consistent with the WRI methodology48, reporting companies may simply use emission factors for 
the reported reserve type (natural gas in this case). 
 
Consistency with SEC and Congressional Climate Risk Disclosure Priorities Although the SEC need not have a legislative mandate to update the 2010 Modernization of Oil and 
Gas Reporting Rule with the disclosure of effective CO 2 emissions factors49, the Climate Risk  
Disclosure Act includes a section that aligns very well with the methodology outlined in this comment 
letter. In July 2019, Senator Elizabeth Warren50 and Congressman Sean Casten51 introduced The

 Climate Risk Disclosure Act, because: 
 
""Investors lack access to basic information about the potential impact of the climate crisis on 
American companies52."" 
 
The Climate Risk Disclosure Act references a mandate for disclosures under Section 13 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 that include “the potential amount of direct and indirect greenhouse gas 
emissions that are embedded in proved and probable hydrocarbon reserves, with each such calculation 
presented as a total, as well as in subdivided categories, by the type of reserve”53. A complete excerpt 
from the Act is in the Figure below:

The IPCC-based effective CO 2 emissions factors from oil and gas reserves would address the mandate 
outlined in this proposed legislation.  
 
In February 2010, the SEC issued “Interpretive Guidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate 
Change”54. In that guidance the Commission identified four existing items in Regulation S-K that may 
require disclosure related to climate change: description of business, legal proceedings, risk factors, 
and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, or 
MD&A. All of these are backward-looking and non-quantifiable considerations.  
 
During its review of Regulation S-K completed in February 2020, the SEC passed on the opportunity 
to update this guidance55. At that time, SEC Commissioner Allison Lee expressed disappointment 
with this decision and pointed out “investors are overwhelmingly telling us, through comment letters 
and petitions for rulemaking, that they need consistent, reliable, and comparable disclosures of the 
risks and opportunities related to sustainability measures, particularly climate risk56.”  
 
Inclusion of CO 2 emissions factors for oil and gas reserves in SEC disclosure requirements would 
enable the Commission to substantially enhance its climate risk disclosure guidance, as represented by 
its 2010 “Interpretive Guidance Regarding Disclosure Related to Climate Change”.

 Comparison Effective CO2 Emissions Disclosure Proposal to Voluntary Standards 
The following is an overview of the guidance of five leading climate risk disclosure standards 
regarding effective CO 2 emissions and related risks represented by the fossil fuel reserves of oil, gas 
and mining companies.  
 
The standards reviewed include the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sector Standards for Oil, Gas 
and Coal; the Greenhouse Gas Protocol; the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Oil 
and Gas Exploration and Production57 and Coal Company58 standards; the Task Force on Climate-
Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) guidance for the Energy Sector; and the Climate Disclosure 
Standards Board (CDSB) Framework. 
 
Key Points 
 
1. The standards with specific guidance for the disclosure of CO 2 emissions represented by 
fossil fuel reserves (GRI, GHG Protocol and SASB) validate the assumptions of the effective 
CO2 emissions of oil and gas reserves proposal outlined in this comment. 
 
2. None of the standards or their guidance contradict this proposal in methodology or 
application. 
 
3. The GHG Protocol and the GRI include reference to a 2016 World Resources Institute 
(WRI) working paper titled A Recommended Methodology for Estimating and Reporting the 
Potential Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Fossil Fuel Reserves . This working paper, which 
was referenced earlier in this comment letter, presents a methodology that is consistent with 
our proposal, but which includes more extensive GHG emissions inputs.  
 
4. The TCFD Energy Sector guidance included no specific reference to disclosing effective 
CO2 emissions in oil and gas reserves, but it did include disclosure of Scope 3 emissions, 
which could be understood to include the emissions addressed by this proposal. The CDSB 
Framework included no guidance directly relevant to this proposal, but it is a reporting 
framework that references other reporting standards such as the TCFD.  
 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is an international independent standards organization that 
provides reporting guidance for companies and public entities on issues such as climate change, 
human rights and corruption. GRI was formed by Ceres and Tellus Institute with the support of the 
United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) in 1997. In 2019, GRI started an effort to develop 
disclosure standards by sector and began the project with the oil, gas and coal industries. The sector 
guidance development process has included a comment period on an exposure draft that closed on 
October 6, 202059. (The Sector Standard: Oil and Gas is expected to be released in mid-2021 and the 
Sector Standard: Coal is expected to be released by the end of 2021.)

58 https://www.sasb.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Coal_Operations_Standard_2018.pdf 
59 In October 2020, PWYP US submitted comments on the GRI Oil and Mining Sector Reporting exposure draft that included 
the following feedback regarding risk disclosure related to fossil fuel reserves.  
 
Climate resilience and transition 
  
In the last bullet point of the third section under “What to report” (Line 513) GRI  should specify that this disclosure should 
include both proven and probable reserves sorted by reserves type.  
 
The use of proven and probable fossil fuels reserves sorted by reserves type as  the basis to assess carbon risk is a forward 
looking metric, which has advantages over historic metrics such as CO2 emissions.  
 
The reserve type should be indicated in a manner consistent with the “Default CO2 Emissions Factors for Combustion” of the 
IPCC’s Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ( https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/ ). Aligning the disclosure of proven and probable reserves with the IPCC’s categories will aid in the quantification of the effective CO2 Page 22 of 30  
  
The GRI Oil and Mining Sector Reporting exposure draft includes general references to the risks 
posed by the development of existing fossil fuel reserves. It also features more specific consideration 
in its Climate Resilience and transition section. Specifically, it recommends disclosure of the 
following.  
 
“Investments in exploration of new oil and gas reserves and development of new fields (percentage of 
total CAPEX) Estimated reserves by resource type and emission potential of these reserves60.”  
 
GRI suggests referring to WRI's working paper A Recommended Methodology for Estimating and 
Reporting the Potential Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Fossil Fuel Reserves  to calculate emission 
potential of fossil fuel reserves . The paper is summarized in the GHG Protocol section of this 
document.  
 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) is a partnership between WRI and the World Business 
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Corporate Standard. It first published reporting 
standards in 2001 and has evolved these to help companies and public entities account for emissions 
throughout their value chains.  
 
The GHG Protocol divides emissions into three scopes. Scope 1 is direct GHG emissions, Scope 2 
covers indirect GHG emissions from consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam; and Scope 3 
is indirect emissions from value chain activities. Each emission scope is further broken down into 
upstream and downstream activities. The effective CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel reserves could be 
considered Scope 3 emissions from a downstream activity, as the emissions from combusted reserves 
would fall under ""Use of Sold Products"".  
 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) is a non-profit organization, founded in 2011 
to develop sustainability accounting standards. Just as the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) have established International 
Financial Reporting Standards and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), respectively, 
SASB's mission “is to establish industry-specific disclosure standards across ESG topics that facilitate 
communication between companies and investors about financially material information."" 
 
SASB has Oil and Gas Exploration and Production61 and Coal Company62 standards that include 
guidance relevant to fossil fuels reserves disclosure.  
 
The SASB oil and gas reserves calculation recommendation is that the reporting entity should follow 
guidance published by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its Oil and Gas 
Reporting Modernization (Regulation S-X Section §210.4-10) for the classifying of reserves as 
proved and probable. For coal reserves, SASB’s definition is consistent with the SEC Industry Guide 
7, Description of Property by Issuers Engaged or to Be Engaged in Significant Mining Operations63, 
which states the following: 
 
1. Reserves, as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted 
or produced at the time of the reserve determination  
 emissions represented by the reserves of a fossil fuel company, which should be an important consideration in determining 
 their exposure of regulatory and demand risks related to climate change.

 2. Proved reserves, as reserves for which (a) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in 
outcrops, trenches, workings, or drill holes; grade and/or quality are computed from the 
results of detailed sampling, and (b) the sites for inspection, sampling, and measurement are 
spaced so closely and the geographic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth, and 
mineral content of reserves are well established.  
3. Probable reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from 
information similar to that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection, 
sampling, and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The 
degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured) reserves, is high enough 
to assume continuity between points of observation.  
 
Guidance for Reporting Estimate CO2 Emissions from Reserves 
The SASB Oil, Gas and Coal standards have guidance for reporting the estimated CO2 emissions 
represented by proven and probable reserves. The SASB standard suggests reporting estimated carbon 
dioxide emissions embedded in proved hydrocarbon reserves in Metric tons (t) CO2-e. The standard 
suggests calculating the estimated potential carbon dioxide emissions from proved hydrocarbon 
reserves using the following formula, derived from a study titled Greenhouse-gas emission targets for 
limiting global warming to 2 °C64 published in the journal Nature in April 2009 by Malte Meinshausen 
et al, outlined in the Figure below. 
 
Figure 12 
Emission Targets

The SASB standard also suggests the following: 
 
“In the absence of data specific to the entity’s hydrocarbon reserves, carbon content shall be 
calculated using default data for each major hydrocarbon resource published by the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas 
Inventories. The entity shall use default carbon content values per unit of energy that is listed in IPCC 
Table 1.3 Default Values of Carbon Content, Volume 2: Energy, Chapter 1. The entity shall use 
calorific values per weight of hydrocarbon contained in IPCC Table 1.2 Default Net Calorific Values 
(NCVs) and Lower and Upper Limit of the 95% Confidence Intervals, Volume 2: Energy, Chapter 1. 
For other assumptions required to estimate the carbon content of hydrocarbon reserves, the entity shall 
rely on guidance from the IPCC, Greenhouse Gas Protocol, U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA), 
or the International Energy Agency (IEA).”  
 
The SASB standards for Oil, Gas and Coal go on to suggest reporting of the sensitivity of hydrocarbon 
reserve levels to future price projection scenarios that account for a price on carbon emissions. The 
 
64 https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08017  
Page 24 of 30  
 standard suggests disclosing sensitivity analyses of a report's reserves using the International Energy 
Agency (IEA) in its World Energy Outlook (WEO) scenarios in a manner similar to the following

Both reporting standards also use the proximity of reserves to areas of significant sustainability 
importance as a suggested reporting metric. For example, a suggested metric for Biodiversity Impacts 
is “percentage of proved and probable reserves in or near sites with protected conservation status or 
endangered species habitat”. The Oil, Gas and Coal standards suggest reporting the percentage of 
proven and probable reserves “in or near areas of conflict” and “in or near indigenous land”. Finally, 
both standards also recommend reporting of the percentage of proven and probable reserves in 
countries that have the 20 lowest rankings in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception 
Index. 
 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is an organization that was 
established in December 2015 by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international body that 
monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. The TCFD, which is chaired 
by Michael Bloomberg, has published a set of voluntary climate-related financial risk disclosures for 
various business sectors. The TCFD’s first guidance document was published in 201765. It includes 
climate disclosure guidance for the Financial Services Sector and Energy Sector that have relevance to 
the effective CO2 emissions in fossil fuel reserves. The TCFD’s guidance indicates that GHG 
emissions should be calculated in line with the GHG Protocol methodology to allow for aggregation 
and comparability across organizations and jurisdictions.  
 
Energy Sector Guidance The TCFD recommendations for Energy Sector reporters include the following regarding historical 
GHG emissions but include no reference to fossil fuel reserves66.  
 
 Estimated Scope 3 emissions, including methodologies and emission factors used 
 Describe current carbon price or range of prices used 
 Amount of gross global Scope 1 emissions from: (1) combustion, (2) flared hydrocarbons, (3) 
process emissions, (4) directly vented releases, and (5) fugitive emissions/leaks

 Financial Services Guidance 
The TCFD Carbon Footprinting and Exposure Metrics for Financial Services companies also provide 
potentially useful insights for the calculations of potential GHG emissions as a proportion of 
investment assets. TCFD offers four suggested methods for carbon footprinting and exposure metrics, 
using issuer’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions as the carbon quantity input67. None of these 
calculations or other TCFD data guidance includes fossil fuel reserves data, but it is possible they 
could be adjusted to do so. 
 
Method 1 - Weighted Average Carbon Intensity 
 
Portfolio’s exposure to carbon-intensive companies, expressed in tons CO2e / $M revenue. Metric 
recommended by the Task Force. 
 
 
 
Method 2 - Total Carbon Emissions  
The absolute greenhouse gas emissions associated with a portfolio, expressed in tons CO2e. 
 
 
 
Method 3 - Carbon Footprint 
 
Total carbon emissions for a portfolio normalized by the market value of the portfolio, expressed in 
tons CO2e / $M invested. 
 
 
 
 
Method 4 - Carbon Intensity 
 
Total carbon emissions for a portfolio normalized by the market value of the portfolio, expressed in 
tons CO2e / $M invested.

 Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) 
The Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB) is an international consortium of business and 
environmental NGOs including Ceres, GHG Protocol Initiative, the World Resources Institute (WRI) 
and SASB that was created during the 2007 World Economic Forum in Davos. The Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP) acts as CDSB’s secretariat. The CDSB Framework does not include specific 
reporting guidance itself but organizes existing reporting standards including the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the International Financial Reporting Standards. 
 
Climate Risk Disclosure The CDSB Risks and Opportunities section identifies areas that would be broadly relevant to the 
disclosure of the effective CO 2 emissions of oil and gas reserves68. However, it lacks specific 
guidance about those disclosures. Instead, it references reporting principles and guidance from other 
organizations. For example, it points reporters to the guidance of Carbon Tracker regarding whether 
an organization’s natural capital dependencies are subject to known limits, e.g., planetary boundaries. 
Carbon Tracker's CO 2 budget research could apply to this guidance.  
 
Application of Effective CO2 Emissions Data to Securities Analysis As discussed at the outset, investors are attempting to price climate risks in an environment of 
significant uncertainty. Figure 15 below highlights the broad categories of risks that portfolio investors 
face. All four of the risk channels outlined below can result in unexpected capital loss for the exposed 
firm. 
 
Figure 15 
Climate Risk Disclosure Act 
 
Source: WK 
Each channel transmits effects in a slightly different manner: 
 
• Physical Risks : Physical impacts on property, plant and equipment (e.g. heatwave, drought, 
storm, flood, fire, sea level rise) can incur significant capital losses. Effects include, property 
 
68 https://www.cdsb.net/sites/default/files/cdsb_framework_2019_v2.2.pdf 
Page 27 of 30  
 damage, potential for lower productivity in regions with outdoor labor, greater energy 
expenditures, lower agriculture output due to declining crop yields, higher and more frequent 
costs associated with cleanup, remediation and insurance around extreme weather events  
 
• Regulatory Risk : Regulatory impacts can include tax changes and new licensing regimes.  
 
• Social Risks : Changing patterns of consumption and customer behavior impacts both 
investors and companies. Demand shifts force re-pricing of commodities, goods and services 
resulting in potential impairments and stranded assets. 
 
• Technology Risks : Competition from disruptive technology has implications for CAPEX 
requirements and can drive margins lower. Investment horizons shorten and incumbent 
industries are forced to adapt.  
 
Increasingly, analysts in fixed income are incorporating higher discount rates as a “blunt force” 
instrument to ensure a margin of safety when investing. In discussions with institutional investors, 
these discounts to the cost of capital range between 200-500 basis points. Firms facing the more 
extreme physical and transition risks are awarded higher discount rates. Therefore, in an analysis of 
upstream producers, industry standard oil and gas PV10 is sometimes closer to PV15, under select 
circumstances. A common heuristic employed when evaluating upstream investment opportunities is 
to compare the firm’s enterprise value to PV10. If those reserves are discounted at a significantly 
higher rate, the resulting present value is lower, narrowing the field of opportunity under this metric. 
 
The CFA institute, a respected accreditation body for securities analysts, recommends that analysts 
and PMs model the impact of carbon pricing at $50-$100/tCO2 by 2030. While the impact on 
valuation is dependent on the industry, as well as the particular carbon pricing scheme and various 
emissions allowances, the direct effect will be higher production costs. And the indirect effects will 
come through higher energy inputs, which can pressure margins. Investors are also questioning 
integrated oil price assumptions in a potentially lower demand environment. This can lead to the 
modeling of potential impairments and stranded assets. 
 
Against this backdrop a tool that can clarify the aggregate downstream emissions potential for the 
transportation segment (via the aggregation of emissions from reserves) would provide tremendous 
clarity on the scope of potential risks. The numbers, if ultimately available through improved 
disclosures, would be a valuable input for physical risk models, climate risk portfolio software tools, 
as well as analysis of individual upstream producers.  
 
Applicaton of Data from Effective CO2 Emissions Methodology The result of the effective CO2 emissions calculation described above is a number that can be compared 
to data from peer companies or to a benchmark. Benchmarks could include the effective CO 2 emissions 
of a company if its reserves were made up entirely of crude oil or natural gas. The follwing is an example 
of how the methodology could be applied to the FY2012 reserves disclosure of Suncor Energy, a firm 
in the spotlight at the time of the Modernization rule.  
 Page 28 of 30  
 Figure 16 
Suncor Energy Reserves Disclosure, FY2012 
 
Source: WK Associates 
As described above, each type of oil-equivalent proven and probable reserves total is multiplied by its 
corresponding IPCC effective CO 2 emissions factor, as indicated in Figure 7. In this case, these 
emissions factors were totalled and then calculated on a weighted basis by reserves type. The result is 
an effective CO 2 emissions fact of all of Suncor’s reserves. Once a company’s effective CO 2 
emissions factor is calculated, it is benchmarked against the IPCC data to determine if it is higher or 
lower than a benchmark based on the effective CO 2 emissions factor of crude oil. High-carbon fuels 
are generally understood to be those with carbon content higher than crude oil. The precedent for 
using a crude oil as a benchmark for carbon content includes the Energy Independence and Security 
Act of 2007, which prohibits the U.S. federal government agencies from buying fuels with carbon 
content higher than crude oil. 
 
Using this methodology, we can see that Suncor's FY2012 reserves CO 2 emissions factor is 78,050 
(kg/TJ)2. When that number is compared to the emissions factors listed in Figure 7, we see it is a 
6.5% higher factor than if all its reserves were crude oil and 39.1% higher than if all of Suncor’s 
reserves were solely natural gas.  
 
As Figure 17 demonstrates, effective CO 2 emission data could be applied to portfolio decision-making. 
In the example provided, the oil and gas exploration and production company holdings in a particular 
portfolio are compared based on their effective CO 2 emissions score. These data indicate that Suncor 
Energy and Cenovus Energy both have effective CO 2 emissions score above a crude oil benchmark. 
This information could help securities analysts screen portfolios for holdings that present material 
climate risks in this manner.

Use of Effective CO2 Emission Data in Estimating Carbon Tax Impacts 
Assuming the implementation of an economy-wide carbon tax based on fossil fuel production, 
effective CO 2 emissions factors would be an essential tool in understanding a security’s exposure to 
such a tax on a forward-looking basis.   
 
Use of Effective CO2 Emission Data in Reserves Decline Estimations In a net asset value (NAV) approach to oil and gas securities valuation, the reserves of a company are 
drawn down to zero through the subtraction of year-over-year production. The resulting NAV can be 
compared to company estimates and the NAV calculations of other oil and gas producers. The 
effective CO 2 emissions of reserves could be included in the calculation of the decline of the reserves 
in a NAV, thereby reflecting reserves based diminished by the marketability of higher carbon 
reserves.  
 
We are grateful that the Commission has undertaken this effort to understand the need for climate data 
and we look forward to seeing how input from this comment period is reflected in your next steps on 
these critical issues. Whatever action the Commission chooses to take, it is our recommendation that 
any climate data disclosure the SEC requires should be mandatory and not grounded in a principles-
based approach. While the voluntary disclosure standards referenced in this comment have been 
beneficial, the consistency and standardization necessary to optimize the usefulness of climate data to 
investors is only possible through mandatory reporting. As indicated above, we also believe this 
reporting should be included in issuers’ standard annual reports, such as Form 10-K or 20-F.  
 
Thank you for the opportunity to share these insights based on our experience and consultation with 
colleagues in the securities field. We welcome the opportunity to engage further on any of these 
issues.

The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related
Disclosur es for  Investor
Dear Secretary Countryman,
(001)
We
write
to
provide
comment
in
response
to
The
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
(the
""Commission"")
request
for
public
input
on
the
2
proposed
rule
""The
Enhancement
and
Standardization
of
Climate-Related
Disclosures for Investors""
(the “Climate Disclosure
Rule”).
(002)
We
agree
that
the
Climate
Disclosure
Rule
is
necessary
to
allow
understandings
of
material
investment
risks
posed
by
climate
matters,
in
both
the
short term and over the long-term.
(003)
Further,
the
Commission's
March
15,
2021,
request
for
comments
on
Climate
Change
Disclosures
item
15
stated:
“In
addition
to
climate-related
disclosure,
the
staff
is
evaluating
a
range
of
disclosure
issues
under
the
heading
of
environmental,
social,
and
governance,
or
ESG,
matters.
Should
climate-related
requirements
be
one
component
of
a
broader
ESG
disclosure
framework?
How
should
the
Commission
craft
climate-related
disclosure
requirements
that
would
complement
a
broader
ESG
disclosure
standard?
How
do
climate-related
disclosure
issues
relate
to
the
broader
spectrum
of
ESG
disclosure
issues
?”
(emphasis added)
(See footnote 003).
(004)
As
noted
by
the
SEC’s
Asset
Management
Advisory
Committee:
""Indeed,
even
within
each
factor—E,
S,
and
G—there
are
numerous
sub-factors
whose
importance
to
investors
can
vary
depending
on
the
characteristics
of
a
given
business
or
industry;
changing
preferences
and
market
conditions;
or
the
perceived
materiality
of
given
factors.
The
measurement
of
material
E,
S,
and
G
factors
and
sub-factors
can
also
vary
and
in
some
cases
metrics have yet to evolve (See footnote 004).(See footnote 004#1)
(005)
At
the
outset,
we
know
the
Commission
understands
how
‘human
capital’
is
a
material
element
of
corporate
performance,
as
per
the
August
26,
2020
Regulation
S-K
amendments
to
modernize
the
description
of
a
registrants’
business
…“include,
as
a
disclosur e
topic,
description
of
the
registrant’ s
human
capital
resour ces
to
the
extent
such
disclosur e
would
be
material
to
an
understanding
of
the
registrant’ s business
” emphasis added  (See footnote
005)
(006)
Human
Capital,
which
includes
health,
was
identified
by
the
Commission
as
a
“mission
critical
asset”
for
companies.
At
the
annual
general
membership
meeting
of
the
Investment
Company
Institute
on
May
2,
2019,
Chairman
Clayton
said,
“Forty
years
ago
our
rules
said:
‘Tell
us
about
your
plant,
property,
and
equipment.
Tell
us
about
your
sort
of
hard
capital
asset
and
what
they
mean
to
your
business.’
If
I
am
an
investor
looking
at
businesses
today,
I
want
to
know
what
you
are
doing
with
your
human
talent,
how
you
are
growing
your
3human
talent,
how
you
are
accessing
new
talent,
how
you
are
retaining
existing
talent” emphasis added.  (
See footnote 006#1), and
(
See footnote 006#2)
.
(006A)
Commission
Chair
Gensler
(August
18,
2021)
asked
the
Commission
staff
to
consider
a
“human
capital”
disclosure
requirement
for
public
companies.
“Investors
want
to
better
understand
one
of
the
most
critical
assets
of
a
company:
its
people,”
The
tweet:
“
This
could
include
a
number
of
metrics,
such
as
workforce
turnover ,
skills
and
development
training,
compensation,
benefits,
workforce
demographics
including
diversity ,
and
health
and
safety”
(See
footnote
006A),
(See
footnote
006A#1),
(See
footnote
006A#2)
and
(See footnote 006A#3)
SECTION A:
WORKFORCE HEALTH AS A MATERIAL ECONOMIC/INVESTMENT
CONSIDERATION
(007)
In
addition
to
climate
matters,
the
Commission
has
a
generational
opportunity
for
rules
of
corporate
disclosure
for
material
investment
risks
posed
by
corporate
decisions,
actions
and
policies
that
involve
health
that
are
more
comprehensive
than
current
SASB
Standards
–
where
the
current
health
metric
only considers  workforce accidents
(See footnote
007) and (See footnote 007A)
(008)
Further,
we
note
that
corporate
climate
policies
and
actions
go
beyond
environmental
consequences
–
with
significant
negative
health
implications
for
the
corporate
workforce
as
well
as
having
direct
and
collateral
consequences
on
local,
regional,
national,
and
global
public
health
(See
footnotes
008#1)
and
(
See
footnote
008#2).
(009)
We
note
however
that
among
the
human
capital
factors
that
are
listed
for
disclosure
by
the
amended
S-K
Regulation,
other
than
a
superficial
mention
of
employee
safety
(as
per
the
above
referenced
SASB
Standard),
the
more
significant
issues of workforce health discussed herein are ignored
(See footnote 009).
(010)
We
believe
an
initial
step
for
a
comprehensive
health
disclosure
mandate
would
be
discussion
and
analysis
by
the
Commission’s
Asset
Management
Advisory
Committee
that
would
consider
health
standards
within
4the
context
of
other
ESG
disclosures
(See
footnote
010#1),
(See
footnote
010#2),
and
(See
footnote 010#3)
(011)
This
standard
would
(i)
be
transparent
in
design
–
based
on
relevant
metrics
sourced
from
advice/expertise
from
individuals/organizations
across
the
spectrum
of
public
health
issues/solutions,
including
disability
advocacy
organizations;
public
health
support
organizations;
unions,
and
their
pension
plans;
public
employee
pension
funds;
hospital
system
endowments;
worker
rights
organizations;
academic;
public
health
institutions;
and
organizations
with
more
generalized
ESG
agendas;
(ii)
avoid
conflict
of
interest
and
the
‘aggregate
confusion”
that
exists
for
climate
change
assessments/ratings,
leading
to
greenwashing;
and
(iii)
take
into
account
the
financial
expense
of
data
collection/analysis
and
corporate
actions,
balanced
by
reduced
medical
liabilities/costs and improved productivity
(See footnote
011).
(012) Preliminary Caveats
A.
This
comment
letter
is
intended
as
a
point
of
departure
for
future
dialogue/discussion
on
the
inclusion
of
health
metrics
as
part
of
a
more
complete
understanding
of
the
S
category
of
ESG
matters.
(See
footnote
012)
It
is
not
intended
as
the
‘alpha/omega’
on
this
issue…which
brings
us
to the other caveats
(See footnote 012A.)
B.
We
see
health
broadly
defined…which
would
include
disability.
Global
competition,
combined
with
low
unemployment,
has
created
a
high
demand
for
skilled
workers.
The
disability
community
offers
a
large
untapped
pool
of
potential
candidates,
but
a
significant
percentage
of
people
with
disabilities
are
not
working.
In
September
2019,
68.7%
of
working-age
individuals
without
a
disability
were
participating
in
the
labor
force,
compared
to
only
20.6%
of
individuals
with
a
disability
(Office
of
Disability
Employment Policy, Department of Labor 2019)
(See
footnote 012B.).
C.
ESG+H
®
assessments
relevant
for
investors
should
be
evidence-based/market-informed
in
areas
of
(i)
workforce
health,
(ii)
how
a
company's
presence/environmental
actions/decisions
affect
the
health
of
the
community(ies)
where
they
have
a
presence,
as
well
as
regionally,
nationally,
and
globally
and
(iii)
how
a
company’s
products/services
affect
5the
health
of
their
customers/users
(See
footnote
012C#1),
(See
footnote
012C#2),
and (See footnote 012C#3).
D.
ESG+H
®
evaluations
will
reflect,
in
many
cases,
the
positive
efforts
of
companies
in
the
above
areas.
Accordingly,
an
above-average
ESG+H
®
rating
will
result
in
an
ESG
rating
that
is
higher
than
would
be
the
case
if
health was not a metric
(See footnote 012D.)
E.
Health,
within
the
context
of
ESG
disclosures
is
where
DEI
was
several
years
ago,
and
it
will
likely
to
take
several
years
before
this
category
reaches
a
‘tipping
point’
where
(i)
its
materiality
cannot
be
ignored
by
investment
advisors,
asset
owners/investors,
ESG
standard
setting
organizations
and
the
relevant
financial
regulatory
authorities;
and
(ii)
it
plays
a
role
in
capital
formation,
capital
allocation
and
risk/return
expectations.
F.

""We

which
generally
may
not
be
subject
to
the

37%
of

did
not
disclose

about
ESG
oversight
at

board
level.
This
variation
may
be
especially
informative
to
the
extent
it
reflects
different

of

(013)
In
September
2021,the
Commission
advised
corporate
registrants
via
a
sample
comment
letter
on
their
ESG
disclosures:
""We
note
that
you
provided
more
expansive
disclosure
in
your
corporate
social
responsibility
report
(CSR
report)
than
you
provided
in
your
SEC
filings.
Please
advise
us
what
consideration
6you
gave
to
providing
the
same
type
of
climate-related
disclosure
in
your
SEC
filings
as
you
provided
in
your
CSR
report.""
Going
forward,
where
a
company’s
CSR
report
discusses
human
capital/health
matters,
the
Commission
is
likely
to
question whether that information is also material to investors
(See footnote 013).
(014)
But
to
date,
workforce
health
has
not
been
evaluated
as
a
material
investor
concern;
rather
as
a
minor
financial
footnote
based
on
work-related
(occupational)
injuries.
As
John
Godfrey,
Director
of
Corporate
Affairs
at
one
of
the
UK’s
largest
financial
services
companies
said:
“It’s
time
for
businesses
to
step
up
and
get
behind
public
health,
and
by
adding
an
‘H’
to
ESG.
Doing
so
provides
a
new
measure
by
which
we
can
evaluate
performance…business
needs
to
be
front-footed
about
developing
ESHG
—
specifically
calling
out
health
in
ESG
investment.
I’d
like
to
suggest
that
health
is
the
new
frontier for ethical and sustainable business” (See footnote 014).
(015)
The
2019
International
Labor
Organization
(ILO)
reports
that
globally
an
estimated
1000
people
die
daily
from
occupational
accidents
(See
footnote
015).
However,
similar
to
how
companies
have
avoided
being
tagged
with
societal
costs
of
climate
change,
the
real
costs
of
corporate
actions
on
health
have
been,
to
date,
a
similar
non-financial
statement
expense,
although
the
larger
mortality
is
not
from
accidents
but
work-related
diseases.
Death
from
work
related
diseases
globally
is
6500
daily
(2.4
million
annually).
Three-quarters
of
these
are
from
circulatory
diseases,
work-related
cancer,
and
respiratory
diseases.
While
safety
needs
continued
attention,
the
focus
must
also
emphasize
health.
The
Americas
contribute
10.9%
of
the
global
occupational
mortality
(occupational
accidents
and
diseases).
(016)
Beyond
mortality,
what
is
the
morbidity
from
disease?
Ill-health
has
global
consequences.
The
ILO
estimated
missed
workdays
from
diseases
and
accidents
reduce
global
GDP
by
4-6%.
The
Global
Burden
of
Disease
study
by
the
WHO
quantifies
incidence,
prevalence
and
mortality
from
diseases
and
injury.
The
metric
is
disability
adjusted
life
years
or
DALY.
One
DALY
represents
the
loss
of
the
equivalent
of
one
year
of
full
health.
During
prime
working
years,
7
of
the
top
10
disease
related
disabilities
were
from
non-communicable
diseases
(See
f
ootnote

).
(017)
From
Punit
Renjen,
Deloitte
CEO
:
""
Achieving
health
equity
is
not
just
the
right
or
moral
thing
to
do.
All
businesses
play
a
role
in
and
are
affected
by
health
7inequities—and
not
just
those
in
the
health
care
and
life
sciences
industry.
Health
inequities
strain
workforces
and
productivity,
create
supply-chain
challenges,
and
have
an
impact
on
the
way
that
consumers
make
purchasing
decisions.
Health
inequities
result
in
trillions
of
dollars
in
lost
productivity
annually.
As
such,
addressing
health
inequities
can
help
business
leaders
accomplish
their
core
business
goals
of
improving
workforce
productivity,
increasing
market
opportunities,
fueling
economic
growth
and
improving
competitive advantage.""

SECTION B
WORKFORCE
MENTAL
HEALTH,
A
COMPONENT
OF
HEALTH,
AS
A
MATERIAL INVESTMENT CONSIDERATION
(018)
Mental
health
of
the
workforce
is
the
fabric
of
human
capital,
and
central
to
corporate
market
value.
During
the
prime
work
years,
depression
was
the
6th
leading
cause
of
all
disability
(3.5%),
anxiety
the
15th
(2.0%)
followed
by
drug
use
disorders
(1.9%)
See
(f
ootnote
18#1
).
And
According
to
the
National
Safety
Council,
about
16%
of
employees
(one
out
of
12
employees)
live
with
a
substance
use disorder
(See footnote 18#2).
(019)
Today's
workforce
is
increasingly
beholden
to
industries
that
use
and
are
derived
from
the
digitization
of
information.
The
COVID
pandemic
demonstrated
that
mental
health
is
the
prominent
vulnerability
in
this
workforce.
A
focus
on
workforce
mental
health
adds
tangible
value
across
the
spectrum
of
industries,
and
independent
of
size
-
from
multinational
corporations
to
small
and
medium sized enterprises.
(020)
Historical
Perspective:
President
John
F.
Kennedy
State
of
the
Union
Speech.
February
5,
1963,
stated,
“I
am
proposing
a
new
approach
to
mental
illness
and
to
mental
retardation.
This
approach
is
designed,
in
large
measure,
to
use
Federal
resources
to
stimulate
State,
local
and
private
action.
When
carried
out,
reliance
on
the
cold
mercy
of
custodial
isolation
will
be
supplanted
by
the
open
warmth
of
community
concern
and
capability.
Emphasis
on
prevention,
treatment
and
rehabilitation
will
be
substituted for a desultory interest in confining patients in an institution to wither away.”
8(021)
Six
months
later,
October
31,
1963,
The
Community
Mental
Health
Act
of
1963
was
signed
into
law,
the
last
piece
of
legislation
signed
by
President
Kennedy.
(022)
Six
decades
later,
the
challenges
of
mental
health
reach
into
every
corner
of
America,
and
we
now
understand
that
these
challenges
have
a
direct
and
material impact on the most relevant of corporate assets…human capital.

2014,
before
a

was
even
a

New

Nicholas

(031)
This

posting
by
Ms.

“
Cognitive

can
be

limiting
in
a

that
relies
more
on

Cognitively

are
more
difficult
for
people
distracted
or
disabled
by
mental

challenges.
Knowledge
workers,
however
—
whose
output
can
be
harder
to
measure
than,
say,
that
of

—
can
also
hide

challenges
longer
and
more
1 0effectively.
With
a

present

When

classic
micro-signals
such
as

1 1SECTION C
WHAT TO MEASURE/ HOW TO COLLECT DATA/ HOW TO ASSESS
DATA
(037)
There
are
necessary
factors
for
H
to
become
a
recognized
metric
in
the
context
of
ESG
assessments.
Factors
such
as
mental
health
or
other
categories
of
health
(workforce,
community,
customer)
need
agreed
on
standards.
Data
collected
for
such
standards
need
to
meet
rigorous,
transparent,
and
trusted/independent methods.
(038) Two fundamental issues are:
(i)
the
need
for
a
health
metric
based
on
design
by
experts
in
matters
of
health,
broadly
defined;
investor
materiality/relevance;
transparency/validity
in
data
evaluation
;
integrity
and
protection
of
human
capital
data;
and
independence
from bias  and
(ii) the  velocity of evolving ESG standards, etc.
(See footnote 038)
(039)
To
address
these
issues,
we
hope
that
the
matters
raised
herein
will
be
useful
for
consideration
by
the
Commission,
as
well
as
US
and
international
standard
setting
organizations
..examples
European
Parliament
calls
for
a
directive
on
psychosocial
risks

What
is
SASB’s
conceptual
approach
to

management?
–
Sustainability
Accounting
Standards
Board
)
(See
footnote 039).
(040)
Any
ESG
measure
of
mental
health
must
relate
to
financial
metrics
(See
footnote
40).
E
xcessive
divergence
in
measures
implies
the
signal
is
lost
in
the
background
noise.
An
acceptable
mental
health
index
should
also
be
available
for
disassembly
to
examine
key
performance
indicators
(KPI)
that
potentially
move
the needle.
(041)
Mental
health
measures
are
fundamentally
subjective.
which
is,
by
definition,
different
from
objective
assessment.
Finance,
based
on
numbers,
are
seemingly
linear,
and
as
units
of
information,
appear
objective
and
rational.
In
1 2mental
health,
there
are
no
objective
measures
or
'biomarkers'
that
are
established
as
independent
validators.
Hence
for
ESG
measures
of
mental
health
to
be
accepted
by
the
wider
corporate
world,
it
is
critical
to
address
their
subjectivity,
else
their
relationship
with
bottom-line
corporate
metrics
will
be
just
spurious
noise.
(042)
The
importance
of
mental
health
to
investors
and
the
global
community
overall
is
rising,
especially
due
to
the
ongoing
effects
of
COVID-19.
Terms
such
as
depression,
anxiety,
stress,
burnout,
etc.,
are
ubiquitous
in
conversations
and
the
press.
The
ESG
investing
space
is
increasingly
focused
on
mental
health,
which
has
fueled
innovation
from
smartphone
apps
to
tele-health
solutions
(See footnote 042)
.
(043)
Focusing
on
workforce
mental
wellness,
there
are
several
published
‘indexes.’
Our
concerns
about
these
indexes
include
whether
there
is
peer-review
of
factors
being
measured;
the
frequency
(tracking)
of
such
measurements;
whether
such
measurements
are
derived
from
company-sourced
data
(versus
third-party
sourcing,
with
individual
confidentiality
protections);
how
such
measurements
are
characterized
for
relevance
for
investors
and
the
companies;
and
whether
the
assessments
generated
by
these
indexes
are
correlations
or
inferring
causative
claims.
Published
indexes
of
mental
health
have
several
components
(See
footnote
043).
(044)
In
many
cases,
indexes
focus
on
workplace
support
(belonging)
and
corporate
initiatives
around
them.
These
include
corporate
attitudes
and
acceptance
of
mental
health
issues
as
valid,
support
from
the
CEO
and
executive
management,
focus
on
employee
culture
engagement,
HR
policies
and
actions
that
support
mental
health
initiatives,
training
of
managers
to
handle
mental
health
challenges
among
their
direct
reports,
etc.
Mental
wellness
is
emphasized
driven
by
needs
for
worker
productivity.
Guidance
on
healthy
exercise,
sleep,
social
relationship
support,
mental
resilience
training,
etc.,
are
offered.
Some
focus
on
brain
health,
offering
physiological
measures
such
as
heart
rate
variability
(assessing
the
tone
of
the
parasympathetic
system),
cognitive
abilities,
etc.
Indexes
also
include
measures
of
mental
ill-health
that
focus
on
depression,
anxiety,
stress,
and
burnout,
etc.,
variously defined
(See footnote 44).
1 3(045)
Mental
health
is
a
broad
term
with
multiple
dimensions
subsumed
under
the
term.
There
are
several
terms
that
overlap
with
mental
health,
including
mental
wellness,
mental
illness,
and
mental
disability.
There
is
a
need
to
harmonize
the
definition
of
such
terms
and
parse
their
distinguishing
characteristics.
There
is
a distinction between mental wellness and mental illness.
(046)
According
to
the
World
Health
Organization
,
mental
wellness
is
defined
as
“a
state
of
well-being
in
which
the
individual
realizes
his
or
her
own
abilities,
can
cope
with
the
normal
stresses
of
life,
can
work
productively
and
fruitfully,
and
is
able
to
make
a
contribution
to
his
or
her
community.”
(Footnote
046)
.
Thus,
wellness
is
not
just
the
absence
of
illness,
but
includes
affirmative
mental faculties and functioning.
(047)
Mental
health
on
the
other
hand,
is
described
by
the
U.S.
government
(
www.mentalhealth.gov)
as
including
""our
emotional,
psychological,
and
social
well-being.
It
affects
how
we
think,
feel,
and
act.
It
also
helps
determine
how
we
handle
stress,
relate
to
others,
and
make
choices.
Mental
health
is
important
at
every
stage
of
life,
from
childhood
and
adolescence
through
adulthood.""
The
loss
of mental health can be defined
categorically
or
dimensionally
.
(048)
The
categorical
approach
is
taken
in
mental
illness
where
labels
such
as
Major
Depression,
distinguish
individuals
who
meet
a
threshold
of
criteria,
from
those
who
do
not.
Such
a
diagnostic
decision
is
the
domain
of
trained
mental
health
professionals.
(049)
The
dimensional
approach,
subsumed
under
the
term
mental
ill-health
,
defines
key
components
and
scores
them
on
continuous
dimensions,
enabling
individuals
to
be
on
a
spectrum
from
health
to
illness.
The
dimensional
approach
emphasizes
that
individuals
are
not
static
in
their
mental
experiences
and
permits
dynamic
tracking
to
document
the
flowing
nature
and
lability
of
mental
experiences.
(050)
Our
ESG+H
Mental
Health
Index
that
aims
to
be
the
standard
in
quantifying
mental
health
issues
for
S
in
ESG.
The
core
is
a
measure
benchmarked
against
a
mental
health
poll
assessment
of
workers
across
industries.
Individual
company
workforce
data
gathered
independently
will
assess
key
elements
of
1 4workforce
mental
health.
Additional
aspects
of
the
ESG+H
Mental
Health
Index
will
include
survey
information
company
contributed
data
that
are
transparent
in
their
design.
Algorithms
will
provide
a
rating
score
that
is
transparent.
Critical
to
this
process
is
that
it
is
ongoing,
such
that
the
tracking
of
information
is
more
contributory than a single point in time rating score.
(See footnote 050)
SECTION D
THE ECONOMICS OF VALID HEALTH ASSESSMENTS
(051)  We understand the Commission’s mandate to include a ‘cost/benefit’
analysis
of
new
regulations,
where
a
Tufts
Medical
Center
Report
could
be
a
starting
point
(See
footnote
051#1)
.
While
the
addition
of
the
H
metric
in
required
corporate
disclosure
will
most
likely
result
in
increased
expenditures,
balanced
against
those
increased
costs
are
tangible
economic
benefits
that
will
result
from
a
focus
on
improving
workforce
mental
wellness,
and
the
collateral
benefits
to
communities
and
customers.
These
benefits
will
include
increased
productivity,
reduced
health
care
costs/liabilities
and
improved
‘brand
awareness
(See
footnote
051#2).
SECTION E
ESG+H
®
- RELEVANT FOR ALL CATEGORIES OF COMMERCE
(052)
Of
the
23
Major
Occupational
Categories
identified
by
the
US
Department
of
Labor
,
the
only
category
(‘Military
Specific
Occupations”)
would
seem
not
relevant
for
the
ESG+H
®
metric.
This
is
especially
true
as
the
ESG+H
®
metric
(i)
broadly
defines
health
to
include
disability,
mental
health/addiction/
women’s
reproductive
health,
chronic
health
(obesity,
diabetes,
cardio)
(ii)
takes
into
account
a
company’s
environmental
actions/decisions
on
health
and
(iii)
does
a
beyond
the
surface
assessment
of
how
a
company’s
products/services
impacts
(positively
or
negatively)
on
users/customers
of
the
company's
products/services
(See footnote 052).
(053)
Companies
with
union
workforce
are
obvious
candidates,
particularly
because
labor
unions
understand
the
mandate
of
The
Mental
Health
Parity
and
Addiction Equity Ac
t
(See footnote 053).
1 5(054)
Of
special
relevance
are
the
health
consequences
for
communities
and
‘customers’
of
social
media
platforms…where
the
adverse
mental
health
consequences
of
can
begin
at
a
very
early
age,
with
suicidal
and
long-term
life-threatening consequences
(See footnote 054).
(055)
Mikaila
Nichols
provides
first-person
testimony,
""It’s
a
Tuesday
night
and
I
have
just
finished
dinner,
my
phone
begins
to
ring
and
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
is
a
child
in
middle
school.
Upon
answering
they
tell
me
that
they
want
to
take
their
life
because
they
feel
as
though
they
are
not
good
enough…
This
is
the
impact
that
social
media
has
on
our
youth.
Children,
teens
and
even
adults
are
chasing
a
reality
that
will
never
come
true.
As
someone
who
travels
the
country
speaks
to
our
youth,
I
have
found
that
people
are
suffering
from
eating
disorders,
cyber-bullying,
and
increased
risk
of
suicide
due
to
the
lack
of
care
that
social
media
conglomerates
have
when
it
comes
to
humanity”
(See footnote 055).
(056)
Dr
Philip
Ninan,
provides
another
perspective
on
social
media
platforms:
“Companies
foundationally
based
on
access
through
the
internet
monetize
the
attention
of
users
through
the
selling
of
advertisements.
This
is
particularly
true
for
social
media
companies.
Sophisticated
algorithms
aim
to
sustain
engagement
as
the
dominant
aim.
How
is
this
achieved?
A
feature
in
the
design
of
brain
systems
that
underlie
the
human
mind
is
leveraged
to
sustain
attention
and
engagement.
The
feature
is
that
preconscious
(non-voluntary)
attention
is
reinforced
by
a
subjective
sense
of
reward
and
avoidance/distraction
from
distress.
Craving
for
these
transient
states
is
reinforced
through
features
such
as
‘likes’,
‘share’,
‘retweet’
and
other
tools
which
feed
perceived
social
capital.
Reinforcement
transitions
to
habitual
behaviors
to
compulsive
behaviors
in
a
proportion
of
individuals
-
with
significant
mental
health
consequences.
(
Footnote
056#1
)
The
circuitry
and
chemistry
underlying
these
mechanisms
have
been
extensively
studied
and
delineated.
Animals
modeling
such
responses
will
work
for
such
artificially
enhanced
reward
over
need
for
sleep,
food
and
even
sex.
In
humans,
executive
override
typically
offers
choices
to
control
such
urges
and
behaviors.
In
the
pre-internet
era
general
population,
this
loss
of
executive
control
affected
a
relative
minority
of
humans.
Corporations,
with
considerable
ingenuity,
have
demonstrated
that
this
system
can
be
hijacked
in
a
much
larger
proportion
of
humans,
with
toxic
consequences.
The
most
vulnerable
are
the
incompletely
developed
-
the
preteens
and
teenagers.
Are
they
being
sacrificed
for
the
corporate
bottom
line?
This
is
arguably
the
equivalent
to
climate
change
of
the
human
mind.
These
are
complex
issues,
with
much
room
for
disagreement
on
the
inferences
that can be drawn from the data
(Footnote
056#2).
1 6SECTION F
DATA ACQUISITION/ PROTECTION/MANAGEMENT/
CYBERSECURITY; DATA PRIVACY
From Theorem One:
(057)
For
the
ESG+H
®
metric
in
the
context
of
ESG
disclosures,
the
issues
of
data
integrity/transparency,
data
security,
cybersecurity
and
personal
privacy
are
more
critical
than
for
other
matters
of
environmental,
social
or
governance
assessments
(See footnote 057).
(058)
Data

professional
assessment
of
data
sources,
systems
of
record,
technical
architecture
and
existing

and
legacy

systems.
To
ensure
data
collection,
quality
assurance,
format
standardization,
and
machine-readable
data
report
readiness
is
effective
(footnote
58),
it
is
recommended
that
public
companies
employ
external
system

data
integration
experts
for
implementation
and
system

Data
Protection,
Security
&
Privacy
is
a
primary
concern
not
only
for
at-risk
employees
that
are
users
of
digital
mental
health
solutions
but
also
for
the
software
application
developers
that
have
ineffectively
protected
the
data
privacy
of their users
(Footnote 060).
(061)
General
reluctance
to
invest
in
operationally
secure
systems
that
protect
user
data
presents
great
risk
and
concerns
during
the
rapid
shift
towards
ESG-related
data
disclosures.
Increased
scrutiny
from
users,
regulatory
agencies,
and
professional
standards
bodies
continuously
define
and
redefine
data
protection
and
security
best
practices
and
expose
companies
storing
user
data
and
solution
providers
to
litigation
risks.
Neglecting
to
address
data
protection,
security,
and
privacy
as
a
core
principle
in
ESG
systems
integration,
migration,
and
reporting
processes
may
result
in
damaging
the
public’s
trust
in
and
brand
perception
of
a
company.
(062)
Throughout
the
implementation
of
data
&
systems
integration
projects,
techniques
can
be
used
to
increase
the
data
protection,
security,
and
privacy
on
an
ongoing basis. These techniques involve a series of activities not limited to:
●
Auditing code releases and software development
approaches
●
Auditing
components
prior
to
release
through
rigorous
testing
automation
procedures
as
a
part
of
the
Continuous

(063)
During
post-implementation,
validation
and

of
system
architectures
provide
an
added
layer
of
assurance
that
systems
have
been
implemented
to
security
specifications,
and
in
turn
reduces

1 8CONCLUSION
(063)
We
understand
that
in
the
coming
months,
the
Commission’s
focus
will
be
on
its
climate
disclosure
regulations.
But
during
this
period,
we
are
hopeful
that
the
Commission
can
recognize
the
importance
of
the
Health
metric
for
investor
understandings
,
extending
the
human
capital
disclosures
that
are
now
mandated
in
Regulation
S-K,
and
finding
bandwidth
to
begin
the
regulatory
process for this metric .
(064)
We
are
prepared
to
engage
with
the
Commission’s
Asset
Management
Advisory
Committee
on
both
the
macro
issue
of
the
Health
metric
and
ESG+H

In

they
noted
--
""Aside
from
data
collection
and
reporting
pitfalls,
we
are
also
concerned
that
a
lack
of
well-defined
rules
on
reporting
key
human
capital
information
may
open
the
door
for
companies
that
have
suboptimal
human

performance
to
pick
and
choose
metrics
that
may
paint
a
misleading
picture
of
their
performance
or
may
omit
critical
information
altogether .
Similarly ,
a
company
that
has
strong
performance
one
year,
but
suboptimal
performance
another
year,
may
choose
to
only
report
certain
metrics
on
years
where
the
results
are
the
best,
leading
to
holes
in
data
and
reducing
comparability .
These
potential

could
reduce

The
Future
of
ESG
Is
…
Accounting?
(hbr.org)
“...an
issue
that
is
not
currently
relevant
to
investors
can
become
so
for
many
reasons,
including
system-level
effects
on
all
companies
regardless
of
industry
(e.g.,
climate
change
and
inequality),
changing
social
expectations
of
customers
and
employees
(particularly
the
Millennials),
and
laws
and
regulations
(e.g.,
carbon
taxes and minimum wage rates).
The
solution
to
this
is
for
the
SSB
to
work
within
its
remit
of
providing
information
to
capital
markets
while
coordinating
with
groups
like
GRI,
which
have
a
concern
for
sustainable
development
that
extends
beyond
investors’
focus
on
enterprise
value
creation
over
the
short-,
medium-,
or
long-term.
Creating
visibility
for
these
issues
can
enable
civil
society
to
spur
regulations
and
laws
that
may
make
these
issues
material
for
investors,
thereby
supporting
both
public and private sector initiatives to address to challenges of sustainable development.”

Interview
with
Robert
Eccles:
If
you
really
do
have
a
view
that
the
corporation
exists
to
do
more
than
make
profit
for
shareholders
and
it
should
have
a
purpose,
you
need
to
have
that
declared
by
the
board.
Based
on
that,
management
figures
out
what
the
material
issues
are.
Then,
that
gets
integrated
into
strategy
and
capital
allocation
decisions.
An
integrated
report
becomes
a
discipline
to
make
sure
you’re
making
progress
on
your
purpose,
and
you
can
communicate
that
internally
and
externally .
That’ s
what
the
ideal
world
looks
like.

""According
to
recent
estimates
released
by
the
International
Labour
Organization
(ILO),
each
year
2.78
million
workers
die
from
occupational
accidents
and
work-related
diseases
(of
which
2.4
million
are
disease-related)
and
an
additional
374
million
workers
suffer
from
non-fatal
occupational
accidents.
It
is
estimated
that
lost
workdays
globally
represent
almost
4%
of
the
world’ s
GDP ,
and
in
some
countries,
this
rises
to
6%

more
(Hämäläinen

Aside

there
is
an
intangible
cost,
not
fully
recognized
in
these
figures,
of
the
immeasurable
human
suffering
caused
by
occupational
accidents
and
work-related
diseases.
This
is
tragic
and
regrettable
because,
as
research

the

century
has
repeatedly
demonstrated,
they
are
largely
preventable.

of

remain
challenged

persistent

overlook

H u m
an
capital
is
a
critically
important
source
of
corporate
value
creation
in
the
modern
economy,
yet
disclosures
related
to
what
executives
commonly
refer
to
as
their
“most
important
asset”
have
been
extremely
limited
relative
to
those
of
other
asset
classes.
This
was
supposed
to
change
in
November
2020
when
the
SEC’s
amendment
to
Regulation
S-K
took
effect.
The
new
rules
require
that
filers
provide
expanded
discussion
related
to
the
firm’s
human
capital
(HC)
as
part
of
Item
1
(i.e.,
the
business
description
section)
of
their
10-K
filing.
The
new
rules
are
principles-based,
however,
so
they
allow
for
a
tremendous
amount
of
discretion
without
stipulating
any
specifics
as
to
what
companies
should
disclose.
Early
critics
expressed
concern
that
this
approach
would
lead
to
too
much
heterogeneity
in
HC
disclosures,
that
it
was
fraught
with
the
potential
for
“greenwashing,”
and
that
it
would
otherwise not yield the comparable
quantitative
data
that investors need to properly assess corporate performance.

Further to the above

that

and

The

Confronts

Presented

Transition
,
asset 
managers
face
challenges
when
assessing
the
sustainability
of
their
investments
and
then
disclosing 
those
characteristics
to
investors
due,
in
part,
to
the
lack
of
coherent
ESG
ratings
based
on
consistent 
and
reliable
criteria
and
methodologies.
There
are
currently
more
than
600
ESG
standards
and 
frameworks,
data
providers,
and
ratings
and
rankings,
provided
by
a
mix
of
established
credit
ratings 
agencies
and
data
vendors,
along
with
niche
providers.
At
present,
there
is
very
little
consistency 
across
ESG
ratings
providers
and
no
established
industry
norms
relating
to
disclosure,
measurement, 
transparency
and
quality.
This
poses
challenges
to
investors
and
fund
managers
seeking
ESG 
investment
opportunities
and,
at
worst,
raises
concerns
that
the
lack
of
consistency
may
facilitate 
greenwashing.
These
challenges
are
only
likely
to
increase
as
ESG
assets
are
estimated
to
reach
$53
trillion
by
2025
10
and
risk
outstripping
the
capabilities
of
existing
ratings
providers.
In
this
area,
many
investors
prefer
active
investment
strategies
and
“want
managers
to
use
active
security 
selection
to
uncover
ESG
opportunities
and
active
ownership
to
engage

undoubtedly
aware
that
investors
are
considering

for
their
investment
decisions
matters
that
look
beyond
traditional
financial 
metrics
.--hence,
considerations
of
ESG
matters
that
may
not
have
a
direct 
relationship to near-term corporate financial performance.
(A109)
As
per
the
The
Business
Roundtable:
The
Business
RoundTable’s 
Purpose Statement, One Year On (harvard.edu)
Following
unprecedented
attention
at
this
year’s
World
Economic
Forum
in
Davos, 
climate
change
was
anticipated
to
be
the
leading
ESG
issue
in
2020.
While
climate 
remains
a
critical
issue,
the
pandemic
quickly
redirected
focus
towards
companies’ 
human
capital
management
and
treatment
of
employees—topics
that
fall
under
the
‘S’ 
category of ESG.
(A110)
Social topics as important as environmental
topics
3 4Newsletter of
27 October 2022
Environmental
topics
–
such
as
climate
change
and
water
–
have
regularly
dominated
ESG
discussions
and
the
regulatory
landscape,
while
the
‘softer’
social
topics
have
often
been
deemed
less
important
.
One
of
the
reasons
for
this
may
be
the
greater
availability
of
data
on
environmental
issues,
perhaps
leading
to
less
ability
to
conceptualise
what
good
performance
on
social
issues
looks
like.
However,
as
Thomson
Reuters
points
out,
there
are
social
topics
which
are
extremely
important
are
increasingly
easy
to
measure,
such
as
human
rights
and
diversity,
equity,
and
inclusion.
Supply
chain
audits,
which
account
for
40%
of
corporate
ESG
impacts,
can
uncover
human
rights
failings,
while
strong
grievance
mechanisms
represent
robust
protections.
On
diversity,
equity
and
inclusion,
a
common
area
is
the
internal
representation
at
higher
levels
of
those
individuals
with
underrepresented
identities
or
backgrounds.
As
strong
governance
and
progress
on
environmental
criteria
become
the
minimum
expected
of
companies,
a
proactive
and
positive
approach
to
the
S
offers
an
opportunity
for
companies
to
meet investor expectations while differentiating their impact from peers.

alleging
that
they
knew,

should
have
known,
that
the
products
presented

Mitchell

Re:  Resubmission and Supplemental Comments of the American Chemistry Council on 
Proposed Enhancements and Standardization of Climate -Related Disclosures for 
Investors  (File Number S7 -10-22) 
Submitted via: https://www.sec.gov/ rules/ submitcomments.htm  and rule-comments@sec.gov . 
 
Dear Mr. Staffin:  
In response to the Securities  and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s or “the 
Commission’s ”) October 18, 2022 request for resubmission of comment letters and reopening of 
the comment period  the proposed rulemaking on Enhancements and Standardization of Climate -
Related Disclosures for Investors  the American Chemistry Council (ACC)  hereby  resubmit s its 
July 17, 2022 comment letter  (July Comments) , attached as Exhibit A.1  In addition, ACC 
appreciates the opportunity to supplement its comments based on recent policy and legal 
develop ments directly relevant to this proceeding.2 
As emphasized in its July Comments, ACC and its members believe that public investors 
and shareholders should have access to financial information necessary to assess material 
investment risks and returns assoc iated with publicly held companies , as reflected in the 
Commissions existing climate disclosure guidance .  To the extent that the Commission deems it 
necessary and appropriate to revise its existing regulatory framework, federal policy should 
conform with basic principles of good policy , procedure, and governance . Any standard should:   
• Use reliable data, methodologies, and predictive tools ;

Releases Due to a Technological Error in Receiving Certain Comments , 87 Fed. Reg. 63016 (Oct. 18, 2022); see 
also 87 Fed Reg. 21334 (April 11, 2022) . 
2 ACC serves as the voice of the U.S. chemical manufacturing industry, representing over 190 companies 
producing tens of thousands of products essential to modern life. ACC members work to solve some of the biggest 
challenges facing our nation and our world  by providing chemical, plastic, and polymer products and materials used 
in the institutional, consumer, commercial, and industrial sectors of the U.S. economy.

• Build  off existing information framework and purpose;  
• Recogniz e and account for  practical and business constraints including timing 
constraints, data limitations, consistency with existing procedures, management systems, 
accounting procedures, and access to internal and external experts;  
• Encourag e rather than discourag e socially des irable corporate behavior, including 
sustainable management, planning, goal setting, and investment ;  
• Focus on disclosures that are relevant and material to  financial decision -making by 
reasonable investors and shareholders; and 
• Be consistent with the SEC’ s broader disclosure framework , purpose , and authority . 
Notwithstanding the Commission’s good intentions, the proposal would mark a 
significant shift and departure  from these principles  and result in severe and unintended 
consequences for investors, regist rants, and the broader economy.   
ACC refers the Commission to its July Comments for  a more detailed analysis of the 
proposed rule  and specific recommendations to address its legal, policy, and procedural flaws . 
As a supplement to its prior comment letter, however, ACC notes that recent actions by the 
Supreme Court, Congress, and the Administration reinforce ACC’s concern that 1) the scope of 
propose d rule far exceeds the Commission’s  legislative mandate and aut hority , and 2) the 
proposed rule is premature in light of other policy proceedings currently underway .  
1. The Major Questions Doctrine, as Clarified by the Supreme Court, Likely 
Prohibits the Scope of the Commission’s March Proposal.   
In ACC’s July Comments , we discussed the Commission’s lack of a clear legislative 
mandate and the proposal’s potential conflict with the “Major Question Doctrine” outlined by the 
Supreme Court in prior cases.3 Subsequently,  on June 30, 2022, the United States Supreme Court 
issued it s opinion in West Virginia v EPA .4  In that opinion the Court further expanded upon and 
clarified the doctrine.  First, the Court emphasized that it will look closely at an Agency’s action 
where  “history and the breadth of the authority that the age ncy has asserted, and the economic 
and political significance of that assertion, provide a reason to hesitate before concluding that

Congress meant to confer such authority.”5  In such cases, “something more than a merely 
plausible textual basis for the a gency action is necessary. The agency instead must point to clear 
congressional authorization for the power it claims.”6   
Such is the case here. In no case has Congress granted the Commission express authority 
to require disclosures associated with GHG emissions, and the disclosure requirements 
referenced in the Commission’s 2010 guidance were established pursuant to SEC’s ge neral 
authority to require disclosure of investment information material to the “reasonable investor.”   
As explained in our initial comments, and by others, the climate disclosures here are 
fundamentally different in nature than the type of disclosures his torically required by SEC for the 
purpose of informing the “reasonable investor,” reflecting the Commission’s “[discovery of] an 
unheralded power representing a transformative expansion of its regulatory authority. ”7   
SEC’s assertion of broad authority over GHG -related  reporting is of vast economic and 
political significance not only because of the cost of the rule but because , as discussed below, the 
issue of climate disclosures itself has been considered and addressed  by Congress on multiple 
occasions, with Congress deciding to assign that authority to EPA, not the SEC.  
2. Congress  Tasked Other Agencies  with Regulation and Oversight of 
Greenhouse Gas Reporting and Disclosure.  
ACC’s July Comments highlight the statutory d isconnect between the Commission’s 
broad claim of authority over GHG disclosure policy and the authority already  exercised by other 
Agencies  with far greater expertise and statutory authority.8 Most notably, in 2007, Congress 
authorized EPA to collect and  make publicly available certain GHG information from industrial 
sources. EPA continues to exercise that authority through promulgation and enforcement of the 
GHG reporting rules and broad distribution and public access to company -level data.9  
Congress spoke directly to this issue for the second time in Section 60111 of the 
landmark Inflation Reduction Act . In that provision , entitled “Greenhouse Gas Corporate

Reporting ,” Congress directed funding to the Environmental Protection Agency , not the 
Commission, to support:  
(1) “enhanced standardization and transparency of corporate climate action 
commitments and plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;  
(2) enhanced transparency regarding progress toward meeting such commitments and 
implementing such plans; a nd 
(3) progress toward meeting such commitments and implementing such plans. ”10 
The activities and funding directed to EPA under this provision are notable  for two 
reasons. First, the IRA’s directive to  EPA to support enhanced standardization and transparency 
of corporate climate reporting mirrors a recurring justification SEC uses for its proposal: the 
need for standardization and transparency .11 Second, Congress omitted any reference to the 
Commission in the Corporate Reporting provision, or in any other section of the expansive law. 
This omission, coming in the midst of a pending SEC rulemaking on the very same topic , 
suggests the Commission has misjudged the scope of i ts authority on this issue.  
3. The Commission Is Premature in Trying to Divine, Alone Codify, Consistent, 
Comparable, and Reliable Disclosure Standards.   
The core presumption of the proposed rule is that the Commission has the information 
and expertise neede d to establish economy -wide disclosure standards that would “provide 
consistent, comparable, and reliable —and therefore decision -useful —information to investors to 
enable them to make informed judgments about the impact of climate -related risks on current 
and potential investments.”12 The fact that, just months ago, Congress directed EPA to support 
enhanced transparency and standardization of corporate climate commitments and plans  suggests 
that a unilateral action by the Commission is premature at best, an d likely unjustified at this 
critical juncture.   Moreover, Congress’s direction to EPA reflects Congress’s considered view 
that the tools that the Commission claims to be ready for widespread adoption are not.  
For these reasons, ACC reiterates its recommen dation that the Commission withdraw its 
March proposal and either delay further action on this issue pending further direction from 
Congress  and/or coordination with other federal agencies on proposed action, or, at  a minimum

ACC Comments on the SEC ’s Proposed Enhancements and Standardization of Climate -
Related Disclosures for Investors   
(File Numb er S7 -10-22) 
6/17/2022  
 
Summary of Comments  
ACC appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Securities and Exchange 
Commission’s ( SEC’s or Commissi on’s)  Proposed Enhancements and Standardization of 
Climate -Related Disclosures for Investors  (File Numb er S7 -10-22) (NPRM or Proposal). The 
ACC  provides these comments on behalf of over 190 companies involved in the business of 
chemistry within the United States . ACC members work to solve some of the biggest challenges 
facing our na tion and our world by providing chemical, plastic, and polymer products and 
materials used in the institutional, consumer, commercial, and industrial sectors of the U.S. 
economy .1  
Our members are key stakeholders and par tners in the nation’s drive toward a lower 
emissions future , both as heavily regulated entities and as providers and enablers of the 
materials, products, and technologies needed to reduce emissions across the larger economy. 
These include Large Reporters, Reporters, Small Reporting Companie s (and equity affiliat es 
thereof) , and foreign companies doing business within the U.S.  Our publicly traded  members 
recognize their fiduciary duty to provide investors and shareholders wit h accurate, material , and 
accessible information on the broad range of risk factors affecting the financial health  of their 
investments.  
ACC supports a company -specific, principles -based approach to climate -related 
information  reporting , building off existing climate change frameworks and guided by 
materiality to focus on  disclosures that are relevant and material to investors and shareholders 
without impeding the competit ive marketplace . 
Unfortunately, the SEC ’s proposed rule runs counter to such principles and its own 
legislative mandate . It is legally unsupportable on b oth substantive and procedural grounds.  
Since Congress’ passage of the Securities Act of 1933 and Exchange Act of 1934, the 
Commission has been tasked with “ protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient 
markets, and facilitating capital fo rmation.”2 More than 80 years of experience and precedent in 
implementing these mandates has reinforced th e critical role that materiality must play in 
determining the scope and granularity of mandated disclosure s. The Proposal  largely discards the 
statuto ry reasonable ness and proportionality guardrails as well as its duty to the “reasonable

2 than focusing on the material facts a “reasonable shareholder would c onsider … impo rtant in 
deciding how to vote ”3, however,  the proposed rule essentially codifies provisions from the most 
aggressive voluntary disclosure frameworks, removes the flexibility inherent within them, and 
then adds additional  analytical, substanti ation, and at testation mandates . The resulting Proposal  
would expand federal interference into corporate governance, management, strategy, and 
competition to a degree not seen with other, far more tangible and material business risks.  
Essentially, the Proposal  would put climate risk s in a classification all by themselves , 
overshadowing other traditional risk factors , reshaping both S -K and S -X filings , and ballo oning 
the cost of compliance. By the Commission’s own conservative estimate, companies already 
spend more than $3. 8 billion annually to report material climate risks and impacts under the 
current materiality -based, narrative disclosures framework of the 20 10 rule. Considering the 
scope and detail of the expansive new narrative and quantitative report ing requirements 
proposed, the SEC ’s estimate of only $6.4 billion in cost increases understates the fina ncial 
impact on regulated companie s from recordkeeping, compliance , and legal costs. When 
considering the additiona l indirect (but  unden iable) costs on private and unregistered companies 
and ventures ( including equity affiliates) , the rule grossly understates the economic impact of the 
rule. 
While the proposed rule would do little to inform the reasonable investor, it would 
provide be nefits to some group s – namely  the burgeoning market for climate consultants , 
auditors, and the securities plaintif fs’ bar which Commissioner Peirce aptly names the “climate 
industrial complex .”4 Indeed, if there is any financial impact and climate -related risk that can be 
predicted with certainty under the proposed rule, it is the exorbitant cost of compliance with the 
rule, including staffing, external consultants, and legal fees,  and the increased risk of litigation 
from third parties diss atisfied with the registrant’s mana gement of this complex, rapidly  evolving 
and sensitive issue.  
For these reasons, ACC recommends the Commission withdraw the Proposal  or designate 
it as an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) and work with the r egistrant 
community and investors t o review and address the hundreds of questions raised  in the preamble . 
Alternatively, w e echo comments from other commenters who have requested a 180 -day review 
period in which to study the rule and engage with Commission  staff on the broad -sweeping 
facets  of the proposed rule.  At minimum, if notwithstanding its lack of legal authority and 
inadequate time to comment, the Commission elects to proceed according to the current 
schedule , ACC urges the Commission to address som e of the most significant legal and  
substantive deficiencies in the Proposal  and offers the below recommendations for 
consideration .5  While adopting these suggestions would not cure the fundamental defects with 
the proposal , they would greatly improve the workability of a final action .

A. Introduction and Background  
ACC serves as the voice of the U.S. chemical manufacturing industry, representing over 
190 companies producing tens of thousands of products essential to modern life . ACC members 
work to solve some of the bigge st challenges facing our nation and our world by providing 
chemical, plastic, and polymer products and materials used in the institutional, consumer, 
commercial, and industrial sectors of the U.S. economy . Products of chemistry help protect our 
food supply , air, and water, make living conditions safer , enable lifesaving medical treatments , 
provide access to efficient and  affordable energy sources in the United States and around the 
globe . 
With respect to federal climate policy  and the economy , the chemical industry occupies a 
unique position  as both a  heavily  regulated industry and climate  solution provider . Products of 
chemistry are essential to achieving the nation’s climate, environment , and infrastructure goals . 
U.S. chemical manufacturers supply the pro ducts, materials, and inputs used to help reduce the 
climate and environmental impacts from virtually every  sector of the U.S. economy . Our 
members’ products  help make the building and construction sector more durable, resilient, and 
energy -efficient  and the transportation sector more fuel efficient .  They are investing heavily in 
innovation to serve emerging  and future markets with new, more sustainable products and 
product chemistries.  
From a regulatory perspective, ACC compan ies and their operations vary in size , 
sophistication,  geographic scope, energy sourcing  and inputs , operating requirements, 
manufacturing technology requirements, emissions characteristics, and supply -chain complexity . 
Every member product reflect s a unique combination of feedstock  inputs and sourcing,  product 
chemistries, environmental attributes, and downstream value chain complexity .6  
Given this diversity, it is difficult to generalize  the Proposal ’s impact  on the chemical 
sector  as a monolithic entity . Similarly, the sheer bread th and granularity of the rule  preclude s a 
few simple “fixes”  to address the many p rocedural and substanti ve flaws undermining the 
Proposal ’s factual, legal, economic, and policy foundation.  Indeed, ACC believes that the most 
appropriate course would be fo r the Commission to withdraw the current Proposal  or designate it 
as an ANPR and work with registrants, investors, and other stakeholders to identify a more  
limited , reasonable , and defensi ble set of targeted improvements addressing financially material 
deficiencies in the current disclosure framework .  This approach would allow the Commission to 
fill critical gaps in its analysis,  avoid unnecessary and unintended consequences on public 
mark ets and private entities, reduce the likelihood of reversal on appe al, and ensure that 
Commission policy continues to incentiviz e both market capitalization and voluntary disclosure 
 
6 See ACC, 2021 Guide to the Business of Chemistry  (attached as Exhibit A).    
5 of supplemental climate  and ESG information desired by non-financial stake holder groups  for 
policy and advocacy purposes .7   
In the event the  Commission elects to proceed with the current propos al, ACC 
respectfully provides the following comments to assist the Commission in identi fying  some of 
the major legal, policy, and practica l deficiencies of particular concern to chemical 
manufacturers.  Notwithstanding these comments, ACC retains all rights to challenge or seek 
judicial review of some or all of the provisio ns of the proposed rule on substantive and/or 
procedural grou nds.  
B. ACC members support a company -specific, principles -based approach t o 
disclosure . 
ACC and its members believe that public i nvestors and shareholders should have 
access to financial information necessary to assess material investment risk s and returns  
associated with  publicly held companies . For over 80 years, the SEC  has p rotected that right 
through a series of consistent and targeted regulations and policies targeted to the information 
needs of the “reasonable investor.” As the SEC  reviews its current  regulatory framework, ACC 
encourages the Commission to develop disclosur e policies that:  
• Are supported by reliable data, methodologies, and predictive tools ; 
• Build off existing climate change frameworks ;  
• Are g uided by materiality to focus on disclosures that  are relevant and material to 
financial decision -making investors and  shareholders ;  
• Are consistent and with the SEC ’s broader disclosure framework and purpose ; 
• Recognize practical and business constraints including  timing constraints, data 
limitations,  consistency with existing procedures , management systems, and accountin g 
procedures, access to internal and external experts ; and 
• Encourage rather than discourages sustainable management, planning, goal setting , and 
investment . 
While t he current SEC climate disclosure framework largely align s with these principles , 
the Propos al would mark a significant shift and departure, undermin ing rather than advanc ing the 
interests of investors, shareholders, and registrants.  
  
 
7 Alternatively, the Commission could redesignate the Proposal as an advanced notice of proposed 
rulemaking (ANPR) or extend t he comment period on the current Proposal  to a full -180 days, providin g time for 
additional industry -specific consultations and dialogue.    
6 C. The SEC has exceeded its statutory a uthority   
1. The SEC’s mandate is limited and targeted  
The SEC’s authority to ma ndate corporate disclosure of risk factors is roote d in two core 
federal statutes, section 7 of the Securities Act  (information included in registration statements ) 
and section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act  (registration requirements for securities) .8 These 
provisions have been subject to extensive interpretation by federal courts over the past 8 0 years , 
as well as detailed federal regulatory requirements . Neither the statute s nor existing regulations  
and related caselaw support the Commission ’s broad i nterpretation of its authority to impose 
reporting mandates of the scope , granular detail , and po litical sensitivity  required under the 
Proposal .  
This lack of a clear legislativ e mandate raises fundamental questions about the legality of 
the rule under th e authorizing statutes under both the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and 
the controlling statutes, including if the rule violates the Major Question Doctrine.  As the 
Supreme Court has explained this doctrine  provides that , ""[i]n the absence of a clear mandate in 
the Act, it is unreasonable to assume that Congress intended to give the Secretary the 
unprecedented power over American industry that would result from the Government's view.""9 
The Commission has no such mandate.  
2. The SEC’s mandate does not extend to advancing specific social policies 
The Commission is authorized to establish disclosure requirements that are “necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest or for  the protection of investors.”10 While there may be some 
investors who see investing a s a way to advance social policy goals, the SEC  has historically 
recognized that ""the principal, if not the only, reason why people invest their money in securities 
is to obtain a return. ""11 At minimum, the clarity and specificity of the SEC ’s purpose raise s the 
Commission ’s burden in demonstrating that such onerous and extensive disclosure mandates –
inconsistent with and contrary to prior practice - are consistent with legislative authority and 
congressional intent   Had Congress intended the investor protec tion provisions to provide the 
SEC with authority to require such broad ESG disclosures and fundamentally  change the nature 
of the information historically provided , one would have expected clearer direction from 
Congress .12

alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions —it does not, one might 
say, hid e elephants in mouseholes. ”).   
7 3. Congress granted environmental reporting and regulation to other agencies  
This disconnect between the SEC ’s legislative authority and the proposed rule is 
particularly apparent in the context of the detailed climate emissions reporting  the Commission 
would require for all industries and registrants . The Commission itself acknowledges in its 
economic analysis that “ [t]here are also state and other Federal laws that require certain climate -
related d isclosures or reporting ,” and that “ EPA estimates that the required reporting under their 
rule covers 85 -90% of all GHG emissions from over 8,000 facilities in the United States. ”13 ACC 
members --like many other companies across the United States, operate w ithin a mosaic of 
domestic and international regulatory regimes  overseen by the Environmental Protection 
Agency, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Department of Energy, the Federal Trade 
Commission, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  These regulatory bodies, which 
have a specific focus on industr ies of greatest concern  and author ity to act , already are 
addressing (or will likely soon themselves address) risks posed by severe weather events and 
other climate issues on the chemistry industr y.  
For example, the Environmental Protection Agency currently has multiple ongoing 
rulemaking s in which it is addressing climate change concerns or taking comment on authority to 
address climate change concerns, that either directly or indirectly impact the chemistry industry.  
These include:  
• The Clean Water Act (CWA)  Hazardous Substance Worst Case  Discharge Planning 
Regulations, where EPA is taking comment on “suggestions and supporting rationale and 
data on how best to incorporate clima te risks into CWA hazardous substance” Facility 
Response Plans.14 
• Proposed revisions to the Greenhouse Gas reporti ng rule, where EPA is taking comment 
on updating several chemistry industry relevant reporting requirements, including  
stationary fuel combus tion sources, hydrogen production, petrochemical production and 
suppliers of industrial greenhouse gases.  15 In addi tion, as part of this rule EPA is taking 
comment on potential requiring reporting on purchased electricity, from which the EPA 
indicates it would then calculate indirect GHG emissions .16 
• Proposed standards regulating existing sources of methane emissions in the natural gas 
industry, which provides the primary feedstock and energy source for much of our 
industry’s production .17

members.  18 
Likewise , for example , the Federal  Trade Co mmission (FTC) is an agency whose very 
mission is to protect consumers and competition by preventing anticompetitive, deceptive, and 
unfair business practices ,19 including  environmental marketing claims.  The FTC’s existing 
Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims (Green Guides) contains guidance on 
claims about carbon offsets, ozone -friendly, renewable energy claims, as well as general 
principles around  environmental marketing. The FTC announced plans to review  the Green 
Guides this year, which are expected to include updates or additions to existing guidance  
governing a range of climate -related marketing claims .20 The FTC is well -suited to provide this 
guidance  and has experience  overseeing advertising claims sub stantiation. False claims about 
environmental  benefits are already subject to potential FTC enforcement.21 Some states, such as 
Maine and Rhode Island, have explicitly incorporated the Green Guides  into state law, and 
others, like California, have enacted their own guidelines for environmental marketing claims 
while also references the federal guidelines. Even in states without specific environmental 
marketing laws, state consumer protection statute s abound, sometimes including the option for 
“citizen attor ney general” suits for deceptive marketing practices. Consumers have numerous 
avenues for legal recourse if they believe a company is misleading in its climate marketing, 
without the SEC  stepping i nto the traditionally FTC realm of marketing and advertising 
regulations.  
In light of these realities, it is unclear why the Commission  would elect to expand its 
regulatory scope to include  disproportionate  and duplicative  requirements for reporting on 
climate emissions , corporate climate strategy , and speculative risk and impact assessments , or 
how such activities would serve the public interests articulated for a securities regulatory agency. 
While federal securities disclosure policy might offer a seemi ngly convenient mechanism for 
driving broader fed eral climate policy objectives and restructur ing the economy , the SEC  has 
neither the authority , structure, nor expertise to advanc e such social policy goals while achieving 
its core mission of protecting in vestors.

9 4. The content and prescriptive nature  of the ru le makes this compelled speech 
in violation of the First Amendment.  
The scope and specificity of the NPRM ’s disclosure requirements, particularly those 
governing corporate management , internal operatio ns, and market strategy, raise significant 
concerns about the Commission’s authority to compel disclosure of proprietary information. This 
is not just a theoretical concern. The Commission acknowledges that the proposed rule may 
compel companies to disclos e information they deem proprietary under the ir business model.  
Another potential indirect cost is the possibility that certain provisions of the proposed 
rules may force registrants to disclose proprietary information. Under the proposed rules, 
registran ts would be required to disclose a wide range  of climate -related information, 
including potential impacts on its business operations or production processes, types and 
locations of its operations, products or services, supply chain and/or value chain. 
Regi strants would be further required to disclose  whether they have emissions -related 
targets and metrics or an internal carbon price, and if they do, what they are. To the 
extent that a registrant's business model or strategy relies on the confidentiality of such 
information, the required disclosures ma y put the registrant at a competitive 
disadvantage.22  
This admission highlights a fundamental flaw in the Commission’s calculus . As 
proposed, the rule would  compel company officers  to speak publicly on sensitive , business -
confidential topics on a routine,  ongoing basis, including channeling the beliefs and expectations 
of their company's management and board. It also may force companies  and company officials  to 
adopt aggressive public positions on climate policy that may or may not align with shareholder 
priorities and beliefs .  
In her dissenting statement, Commissioner Peirce observed that “[t]his Proposal  steps 
outside our statutory limits by using the disclosure framework to achieve objectives that are not 
ours to pursue and by pursuing those objectives by means of disclosure mandates that may not 
comport with First Amendment limitations on compelled spee ch.”23 As the Commission is no 
doubt aware, the U.S. Supreme Court long ago settled the fact that “[i]f there is any fixed star in 
our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be 
orthodox in politics, na tionalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess 
by word or act their faith there in.”24 This long -standing prohibition against compelled speech 
was revisited more recently when the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated part  of the 
conflict minerals disclosure requirement under the Dodd -Frank Act because the court determined 
the chal lenged portion rose to the level of unconstitutionally compelled speech.25  
Mandatory disclosures are no less compelled because some  compa nies choose to release 
such information on a voluntary basis, or because some shareholders, activists, or competitors

25 National Association of Manufacturers v. SEC , 800 F.3d 518 (D.C. Cir. 2015).    
10 would like access to that information. The extensive and intrusive reporting requirements 
included within the Proposal , particularly those  governing disclosure of corporate governance, 
internal  management , business operations  and financial analysis, carbon pricing, market 
assessment, and strategic planning, step well beyond any reasonable justification of compelled 
disclosure  and should be  remov ed. These include but are not limited to  decisions on what 
products and product lines to make , sell, or phase out, which suppliers and vendors to use, where 
to operate, and how to conduct internal accounting  and investment allocation , including internal 
carbon pricing .  
Registrants may have a variety of reasons for treating this type of information as 
proprietary and c onfidential.  Disclosure might be used by competitors in appropriating or 
thwarting development, acquisition, prote ction, or sale of intellectual property , strategic 
investments or divestments  in business lines, and analysis and forecasting  of market and p ricing 
trends.  Disclosures could  and would be used by third parties to support legal claims and suits, 
either for f inancial gain , competitive advantage,  or to force corporate conformity with political or 
policy priorities .  
Such outcomes would harm rather than benefit shareholders and investors, undercutting 
competitive advantages from innovative management , strategy, and market innovation , and 
increasing rather than reducing financial risk and uncertainty  from legal, market , and financial 
factors outside o f the registrant’s control.26  
5. The Proposal  conflicts with prior C ommission practice  and precedent . 
The proposed rule is a radical departure from prior Commission rulemaking approaches  
on multiple levels .  The expanded  requirement to quantify risks and impa cts on a regional and 
line-item analysis  conflicts with the treatment of other, far more salient risks  – a fact highlighted 
by the proposed addition of an entirely new Code section .27  
Even where proposed rulemakings have focused on particular social issues  that were  
determined  to present  unique risk attributes important to investors , prior proceed ings have taken 
a lighter hand , and did so with explicit direction f rom Congress to address the issue . For 
example, the Dodd Frank Act’s focus on mine safety and  health disclosures were relatively 
narrowly tailored to risks unique to the mining industry.  The controversial conflict mineral 
disclosure rules, but for portions  that were successfully challenged in court, are also narrowly  
tailored as compared to the prop osed climate risk rules, as the former focuses on the sourcing 
practices related to specified minerals and apply only to those registrants for which the conflict  
minerals are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured  or contrac ted 
 
26 With respect to increased legal risk, for example, even companies adhering  closely to the expansive 
requirements of the proposed rule would have to plan for and incur significant legal fees and costs to prepare for  and 
defend against baseless legal claims  as a matter of business – particularly those in industries targeted by thi rd parties 
for anti -competitive or ideological reasons .   
27 See, e.g., NPRM at 213 45, propos ing 17 C.F.R. §229.1500 –1507  (‘‘Subpart  1500  of Regulation  S–
K’’).    
11 by the registrant to be manufactured.  Banks and bank holding companies are subject to enhanced 
disclosure obligations related to  industry -specific risks.   
The closest recent example to the proposed climate risk disclosure rule is the Dodd Frank 
Act’s s weeping executive compensation disclosure rule promulgated by the Commission 
thereunder.28 Since taking effect, the executive compensation disclosure rules have, for all 
practical purposes, turned public company annual meeting proxy statements into public r eferenda 
on a public company’s executive compensation practices.  Proxy statements have grown 
significantly in s ize and complexity, and public companies dedicate extraordinary financial 
resources on compensation consultants and other third -party advisors, a s well as board and 
management time, year after year.  That said, unlike the proposed climate risk disclosure ru les, 
only public companies are impacted by the executive compensation disclosure obligations, and 
there is a meaningful demarcation between discl osure obligations for smaller reporting 
companies and non -smaller reporting companies. Here, however,  the propo sed rules will impact  
all chemistry industry participants, regardless of size, and even for those not directly subject to 
public reporting.  
Anoth er example of Commission’s overreach is the Proposal ’s mandate to  report  
potential climate risks and impacts at the zip code lev el.29 This level of granularity far exceeds 
the detail any reasonable investor would deem material in making investment decisions . 
Compare, for example, the Commission’s disclosure requirements for registrants engaged in oil 
and gas producing activities , which states that “ geographic area  means, as appropriate for 
meaningful disclosure in the circumstances: (1) By individual country ; (2) By groups of 
countries within a continent; or (3) By continent. ”30 
There is little to no precedent for requi ring mandatory mass disclosure  of the types of 
granular information proposed here, and no risk-based justification for doing so now.  Moreover, 
in some industr ies, highlighting the specific location of facili ties with ph ysical risks cou ld 
actuall y increase the physical and financial threat to corpora te assets from action by  bad third -
party actors . Before the Commission proceeds, it should revisit and recalibrate its approach to 
weighing the materiality and proportional ity of the information streams included in the proposed 
rule.   
D. The Proposal departs from t raditional and important materiality concepts  
One of the most troubling aspects of the propo sed rule is its wholesale rejection of 
materiality and proportionality . The Proposal  rejects fundamental precepts of federal securities 
law, including materiality, proportionality, and a focus on the “average p rudent investor” as 
guardrails for new federal  mandates. This not only imposes undue costs on registrants and their 
shareholders, it  creat es a securities disclosure regime that disproportionately emphasizes 
speculative climate risks over traditional risk f actors , to the detriment of investors .  
 
28 See 17 C .F.R. § 229.402 . 
29 See proposed 17 C.F.R. § 229.1500 (k) and § 229.1502(a) (1)(i)(A).   
30 See id. §229.1201(d).   
12 The Proposal  would impose unprecedented new requirements for information collection, 
speculati ve analysis, and detailed public reporting of current and future operational, 
management, and strategic information in highly  regulated legal filings, with little to no  
consideration of the information’s materiality, relevance, reliability, or competitive sensitivity. 
The Proposal  would i ndirectly mandate scope 3 reporting under a highly subjective and liberal 
interpretation of materiality  to make and defend speculative statements on the impacts of 
complex supply and value chains for thousands of different products, uses, and markets. Each  
statement would be subject to extensive substantiation and documentation requirements as well 
as costly legal review, audits, and in m any cases attestation from third -party experts. Companies 
would face increased administrative, civil, and even criminal e nforcement liability, as well as 
inevitable  activist and shareholder litigation over the highly subjective  assessments and 
predictions of the impacts of climate on future corporate performance .  
For example, the Proposal  would establish entirely new subparts of Regulation S -K and 
S-X focused solely on climate information, much of which is required regardless of traditional 
materiality pri nciples.31 Examples include:  
• Mandatory collection, analysis, validation, audit, and reporting of scope 1 and scope 2 
GHG emissions and emissions intensity, regardless of the nature of the registrant’s 
operation and magnitude of emissions;32 
• Reporting on sco pe 3 emissions under the vague and overly inclusive “materiality 
standard ” implied within the Proposal ’s preamble.33 
• Requirement s for line -item reporting of de minimis  climate -related impact s in Financial 
Statements .34  
• Reporting on “climate expertise” withi n the registrant’s board and management, 
regardless of the significant of climate impacts to the registrant’s business.  
• Costly audit and attestation requirements for many of the new disclosure requirements.35  
This approach undermines  recent efforts by the Commission to make it easier for 
investors to assess the full range o f risks investors face in making investment decisions. Only 
two years ago the Commission adopted rules governing “ Modernization of Regulation S -K Items 
 
31 Proposal at 21335 . 
32 The issue of “emissions intensity” is particularly problematic when required at an industry -wide l evel 
due to the diversi ty of materials, products, services, and supply chains covered by the rule and the thousands of 
factors influencing the “emissions intensity” at the product level, let alone a registrant full product or service 
portfolio. In essence,  SEC can mandate report ing on emissions intensity, and even establish a specific methodology 
(e.g., TonsCO2 per unit of revenue), but the number will have no comparative value or use to investors since every 
company’s number will be influenced by so many u nique factors.  
33 As dis cussed below, w hile the Proposal  purportedly limits scope 3 reporting to “material” emissions, the 
preamble language suggests a standard that would likely capture many companies for which climate considerations 
would be immaterial or difficult to preclude without extensive analysis.

13 101, 103, and 105 ,” amending the ri sk reporting framework to “ result in risk factor disclosure 
that is more tailored to the particular facts and circumstances of each registrant, which should 
reduce the disclosure of generic risk factors and potentially shorten the length of the risk factor  
discussion, to the benefit  of both investors and registrants .”36  
The Commission tries to sidestep the traditional materiality requirement by making 
sweeping generalizations that disclosed information “can have an impact on public companies' 
financial perf ormance or position and ma y be material to investors in making investment or 
voting decisions. ”37 But such speculative and conclusory statements cannot be the basis for a 
mandate of the Proposal ’s scope  without swallowing the entire concept of materiality. In theory, 
any piece of i nformation about a company’s management and operations “can” have an impact 
on public companies’ financial performance, or “may” be material to some investors  in their 
decision -making  process. In practice, however, this is not the standard established by t he courts  
and the SEC  struggles to articulate the materiality/ value proposition for a universally mandated 
disclosures of any type , let alone the level of detail envisioned in the Proposal .38 Simply saying 
information is material does not make it true , nor does the fact that a subset of socially  focused 
investors may prioritize climate information and policy over financial performance .  
This disconnect is particular ly evident when the Commission strays from long -
established precedent . The proposed sectio n § 210.14 -01(b), for example, would require 
reporting of climate -related financial impacts  and expenditures for every line item on the 
financial statement above a one -percent threshold.  The SEC requires line -item reporting only 
sparingly and when it does, it regularly uses a five -percent threshold  or higher .39 The 
Commission has provided no basis for its assertion that information of the unusual granularity 
proposed here is necessary or mater ial to support informed investor and shareholder decisio n 
making , and the handful of references where a one -percent threshold has been used are 
inapposite to the current case .40   Nor does the proposal provide a linkage between the “bright 
line” one -percent line item reporting requirement and materiality, positing only tha t the 
“proposed threshold would provide a bright -line standard for registrants and should reduce the 
risk of underreporting such information ” and “could also promote comparability and c onsistency 
among a registrant's filings over time and among different r egistrants compared to a principles -
based approach .”

14 E. The Proposal ’s scope 3 reporting provisions are overbroad and ambiguous .  
For the chemical industry, one of the most troubling aspects of the Proposal is the vague 
and overbroad requirements governing qu antification and reporting of “material” scope 3 GHG 
emissions and intensity.41 While the scope 3 disclosur e mandate referen ces materiality , the 
exception  for public reduction t argets and the overinclusive materiality test implied in the 
preamble effectivel y ensure that most registered companies  and the ir non-public compan y 
partners across their value chains will be required to analyze  and quantify , if not public ly 
disclose their own Scope 1-3 impacts.   
As a practical matter, there is no consistent, reliable  methodology for determining 
material scope 3 emissions , let alone ensuri ng comparable disclosure s given the diversity of the 
economy.  This task is particularly challenging for chemic al manufacturers, which are not only 
indispensable to the U.S. economy  but ubiquitous  and diverse, as reflected in a recent report by 
the Depa rtment of Energy’s (DOE) Advanced Manufacturing Office . 
• “Chemical products are essential to production of a myriad of manufactured products. 
More than 96% of  all manufactured goods are d irectly touched by the chemicals 
industry…  The industry greatly influences our safe water supply, food, shelter, clothing, 
health care, computer technology, transportation, and almost every other facet of modern 
life.” 
• “The U.S . chemical industry is respon sible for more than a quarter of the U.S. GDP, 
supports the production of almost all commercial and household goods, and is essential to 
economic  growth. ” 
• “The business of chemistry is America's largest exporting sector, sup plying an eighth of 
the world's chemical needs .” 
• “Nearly all goods in use every day in the U.S. are manufactured using Chemical Sector 
products. These goods are found in homes, offices, drug stores, and farms across the 
Nation.  
• “Chemicals and related produ cts make up 10 cents of every  [dollar]  of U.S. exports .” 42 
A recent Department of Homeland Security  analysis reinforces this challenge , finding 
that:

included in a registrant's Scope 2 emissions, which occur in the upstream and downstream activit ies of a registrant's 
value chain …”); id. 1504) (“(c) Scope 3 emissions. (1) Disclose the registrant's total Scope 3 emissions if material  
[or] it has set a GHG emissions r eduction target or goal that includes its Scope 3 emissions. ”)

15 • The U.S. Chemical Sector converts raw materials into more than 70,000 diverse products 
essential to modern life and distributes those prod ucts to more than 750,000 end users 
throughout the Nation.  
• Several hundred thousand U.S. chemical facilities —ranging from petrochemical 
manufacturers to chemical distributors —use, manufacture, store, transport, or deliver 
chemicals along a complex, global  supply chain.  
• End users include critical infrastructure sectors, making the uninterrupted production and 
transportat ion of chemicals essential for national and economic security.43 
These  report s highlight  the diversity of economic activities touched by ch emical 
manufacturers  and the challenge of tracing their impacts across their global value chain s. This 
reach and divers ity not only makes Scope 3 emissions analyses inherently subjective , it 
highlights the unprecedent ed scope  of the informat ion collection mandat e and complexity of the 
mandate  and the challenge of developing reliable, data -driven  analyses suitable for use in 
investment decision -making . 
Even at the company  level , the diversity of products, operations, supply chain inputs, and 
end-uses for products of chemistr y is staggering. Most chemical companies manufacture multiple 
products, each of which may go into dozens of end uses , industries , and links along the value 
chain from cradle to cradle . Few registrants will have access to the detail ed data needed to 
calculate , or even estimate , the emissions associated with their unique upstream and downstream 
value chain.  While some registrants that dominate their supply chain markets or value chains 
may have the bargaining power  to demand some select supp liers or downstream customers 
conduct the requisite analyses and provide the needed information, most will lack the market 
influence to obtain such information , or will be reliant on value chain part ners th .at lack the size, 
sophistication, or resources to  comply  successfully, if under any circumstances .   
Where such data is available, w ithout a clear and consistent understanding of 
organizational boundaries, supply chain and value chain scoping bounda ries, and methodologies 
to calculate and compare scope 3  estimates, the resulting disclosures will be entirely subjective 
and lack any value for analyzing or comparing financial performance.  Many registrants will be 
forced to rely on “best estimates ,” formulas , default data , and industry -wide emissions factors  
provided by consultants  or third -party groups , creating generalized estimates or industry 
averages with little to no probative or financial value for investors evaluation specific companies.  
Such analyses will a lso be exceedingly costly, both for registr ants and their large and 
small value chain partners. Robust information on what these costs would be is lacking, as 
reflected in the SEC ’s lack of reasonabl e estimates and their request for comment for sources on 
 
43 Department of Homeland Security, Chemical Sector Profile  (last visited May 25, 2022),

16 that issue , and44 the Commission’s prelimina ry estimates almost certainly underestimate the cost  
when applied to an SEC filing . The Commission offers anecdotal examples of cost estimate 
provided by stakeholders as placeholder s for meaningful analys es, but such estimates are hardly 
representative or reliable in a compliance context.  Scope 3 consultants and disclosure advocates 
will hav e strong incentives to understate the cost of conducting scope 3 analyses during the 
policy development process, recognizing the short -term benefits of encouraging fede ral action 
and the lack of any long -term accountability for these estimate s.  Indeed, ev en if such estimates 
reflect the current market cost for conducting voluntary scope 3 analyses, the increased rigor , 
expanded scope, short deadlines,  and likely shortag e of trained suppliers will almost certainly 
drive up the cost.  
1. The SEC’s purported limit s on 3 reporting  are belied by the language of 
the rule and the implied standards for demonstrating non -materiality . 
While the Commission frames the Scope 3 reporting  requirement as materiality -based, 
the language of the rule and preamble  suggest the opposite.  The Proposal  demurs on a specific 
definition but directs registrants to the approach taken by a handful of companies in voluntary 
reports, stating “[w]hile we ar e not proposing a quantitative threshold for determining 
materiality, we note that so me companies rely on, or support reliance on, a quantitative threshold 
such as 40 percent of total GHG emissions when assessing the materiality of Scope 3 emissions.”  
This approach puts companies into a very difficult position . Having proffered  the 40 
percent threshold, the SEC  must realize that many companies will feel obliged to apply the 
standard regardless of the materiality of their scope 3 emissions, lest they “get i t wrong” in the 
eyes of the Commission or third -party litigants  and courts .  The absurd result is that 12 out of the 
17 economic sectors tracked by the Carbon Disclosure Project would be deemed to have 
“material ” scope 3 emissions – not based on the signif icance to their operations but due to  their 
comparatively low Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions profil e. See Table 1. Indeed, the only 
industries not captured under the 40 percent standard would be the five most energy and 
emissions intensive sectors of the ec onomy: cement, electricity generation, paper and forestry, 
steel, and transportation.   
 
44 NPRM at 2145 62. Notably , SEC askes for comment on whether the ir estim ates for scop e 3 data 
collection and reporting are accurate .  The answer is  of course no.  In fact, SEC largely aggregates it s estimates into  
data for Scope 1 -3 together .  While it provides e xamp les of cost estima tes provided by individual compan ies and 
some providers, it provides no estimates reflecting the full scope and compliance liability assoc iated with the rule ’s 
requirements, and its estima tes woefully understa te the costs, particularly in the cont ext of the upstream and 
downstream  impacts, which the NPRM acknowl edges  but does not quantify . Id. at 21454 -21453.

sector.pdf?1649687608   
For those concerned with heavy industry not reporting, however, not to  worry.  Having 
set an implied 40 percent materiality threshold, the SEC  goes on to state that “even when Scope 
3 emissions do not represent a relatively sign ificant portion of overall GHG emissions, a 
quantitative analysis alone would not suffice for purposes  of determining whether Scope 3 
emissions are material .”45 The result is an implied standard for scope 3 reporting that deems both 
“a lot” or “a little” sc ope 3 emissions to be potentially material, effectively swallowing the entire 
concept of materiality.  Given the ambiguity, robust scope 3 analysis , documentation, and 
substantiation will be required regardless of materiality to satisfy the proposal’s requi rement . 
For many companies concerned about risk management, these analyses will require 
significant investments in staff and management time, consultant and legal fees, and auditing 
fees, even where relevant climate risks are non -material.  The cost to larg e public  companies will 
not be inconsequential , but it is also important to note that non -public companies within the 
supply chain and downstream customers will face the same dilemmas  as they will have to 
provide information to enable their customers and s uppliers  to comply with the requirements . 
While the Proposal includes safe harbors , these will not eliminate the financial risk and 
uncertainty associated with enhanced , subjective  enforcement and third -party litigation  that goes 
with SEC filings. The assu rance th at registrants may have a potential defense against such 
proceedings will not preclude Legal fees and the risk from nuisance suits are no less relevant or 
financially impactful because companies may have a defense at some point down the road in a 
litigatio n proceeding . 
The Commission’s decision to remove the materiality limitation for companies that make 
voluntary reduction targets is particularly problematic and illogical from both a financial and 
policy perspective. Registrants setting public targ ets or reduction commitments for scope 3 
emissions that are financially material will already be subject for mandatory reporting , making 
 
45 Proposal  at 21335 (internal citations omitted) . 
  
18 the voluntary target exception unnecessary  to carry out the Commission’s mission. Expanding 
the onerous reporting requi rement to non-material  scope 3 emissions  targets simply increase s the 
burden and legal  risk associated commitments that, by definition, will not inform the average 
prudent investo r’s decisions.  This will do nothing but discourage registrants from showing 
leadership through voluntary action to address scope 3 emissions.   
F. The new climate regime  will require an en tirely new field of regulatory, 
industr y, accounting, and legal expertise to appropriat ely design , operat ionalize, 
and implement  this program . 
Commi ssioner Peirce, in her dissent, highlights the risk of unintended consequences 
“when the regulatory complexity is designed to push capital allocation toward politically and 
socially favored ends,  and when the regulators design ing the framework have no expe rtise in 
capital allocation, political and social insight, or the science used to justify these favored ends.46 
The expertise gap does not end with the SEC . The Commission acknowledges that many in the 
regulated community  ""may face significant uncertainty a nd novel compliance challenges.”47 
Moreover, “[t]o the extent this leads to inadvertent non -compliance , registrants may face 
additional exposure to litigation or enforcement action. ”48  
The Commission appears to rely heav ily on third -party experts to pick up  the slack but 
even there, its hopes exceed its reality.  The Commission notes that:  
While some experienced assurance providers may be proficient in applying attestation 
standards to GHG emissions disclosures, other ass urance providers may lack GHG 
emissio ns expertise. Similarly, some service providers providing assurance may have 
expertise in GHG emissions but have minimal assurance experience.49  
This expertise gap is exacerbated by the fact that climate financial risk assessment and 
reporting methodologie s are still very much in flux. The old cliché that the SEC  is trying to build 
an airplane while flying it applies here. The Proposal  presumes that the SEC  can craft , finalize, 
implement, and enforce a massive new disclosur e program  that promotes consistenc y and 
comparability across industries and global jurisdictions , at a time when few, i f any registrants , 
SEC staff, and third -party securities lawyers, accountants , and consultants  have experience, let 
alone ex pertise, to understand,  operationalize, and ex ecute consistent data analysis and reporting 
at the level of granularity required for compliance , and the entire field of climate reporting 
continues to evolve.  This approach is untenable and unreasonable, particularly under the 
timeframes anticipated for f inalizing and enforcing new requirements . ACC is rec ommending the 
Commiss ion extend all deadlines by a minimum of 3 years in order to allow time fo r 
development of a functioning  climate  risk assessment and reportin g framework  suitable for 
economy -wide application , rapid expan sion of the internal and third -party knowledgebase

19 needed to adapt new programs to individual  companies, and implementation of company -specific 
compliance plans.   
G. The Proposal s timeframe for implementing and enforcing the new rule is  
unreasonable  and impracticable .  
The Commission has stated it will finalize the Proposal  by the end of 2022 and that most 
of the rule’s sweeping new requirement s would be phased in for fiscal year 2023 , 2024, and 2025 
for large accelerated filers, accelerat ed and nonaccelerated filers, and small reporting companies , 
respectively , with requirements to calculate and report  scope 3 emissions talking effect a year 
later for each class of registrants.50 Even presuming the Commission were to meet its promised 
promu lgation timeframe of December 2022, th is timeframe is fundamentally unworkable.  
Before the financial community can operationalize an economy -wide climate disclosure 
mandate of this scope and size, it will have to develop  a new industry of climate regulato ry 
advisors , trained and certified by accredited entities to provide technical, legal , and accounting 
advice and oversight of compliance activities. This w ill require  development and approval of : 
• Competency criteria for auditor s reviewing climate statement s and disclosures . 
• Guidance/curricul a for training organizations . 
• Accreditation standards or other methods for ensuring that auditors are deemed 
competent by a third party before being allowed to audit climate statements .  
• An adequate supply and capacity of trained experts , auditors, and supporting 
infrastructure to meet the time-sensitive demand for legal and auditing services tailored to 
each ind ustry sector . 
• Functional markets to connect certified climate consult ants and auditors with the 
expertise neede d to provide attestations for different types of companies  and industries . 
Once this necessary compliance framework is in place, companies will face the daunting 
task of adapting their operation al, legal, accounting , and information management systems and 
procedures to manage the new federally enforceable requirements. This will require significant 
revisions to corporate procedures independent of any experience companies may already have 
with voluntary reporting.51  
ACC’s Responsible Care® (RC)  program provi des an apt illustration of the practical 
challenges and time associated with developing and amending even voluntary reporting 
programs.  Through implementation of Responsible Care®, ACC member companies 
demonstrate  their commitment the health and safety of their employees, the communities in 
which they operate and the environment as a whole. Participation in Responsible Care is a

reporting, particularly in SEC filings, will fundamentally change the nature and cost of climate and sustainability 
reporting activities , particularly for U.S. based companies.     
20 mandatory for all ACC members and Responsible Care Partner companies, all of  which have 
made CEO -level commitments to the program.  The Responsible Care Management System 
(RCMS) is an integrated health, safety, security and environmental management system based on 
the principles of Responsible Care and the Policy -Plan-Do-Check -Act continual improvement 
cycle.52 ACC members and Responsi ble Care Partners are required to demonstrate conformance 
to this technical specification . . . or conformance to the RC14001® technical specification as 
part of their overall Responsibl e Care obligations. Conformance is determined through an 
independent t hird-party audit conducted according to established ACC procedures .53 
ACC completed the applicable standards for RC compl iance and related auditing in 2003 . 
It took more than 18 months , however, before a sufficient number of  auditing companies and 
individua l auditors were accredited to conduct audits for our members/ RC Partners.   
When updating existing RC program Codes, ACC gives members 1.5 to 2 years to 
implement  the changes , conduct  workshops/trainings for auditors , and develop and distribut e 
guidelines t o auditors well in advance . Many auditing models provide up to 3 years for 
introduction of new auditing requirements to allow all parties – organizations being audited, 
auditing firms, individual auditors, etc. – to fully u nderstand and prepare . For exampl e, during 
the last major revision to the ISO 14001 environmental management system  (EMS standard), a 
three -year transition process was adopted due to the significant changes made to the standard’s 
requirements.54. When the ISO 45001 OHS standard was introdu ced, organizations once again 
had three  years to transition from a previous Occupational Safety MS standard known as OHSAS 
18001.55 
Building a new industry of auditing experts and information management systems  is 
likely to be harder looking forward. The au diting community, like many other industry sectors is 
going through a transition as many people are retiring , and fewer newcomers are entering the 
auditing ranks . Auditors that may need training vis -à-vis climate statements must obtain this 
training while still maintaining their current schedule of audits , meaning  it may take many 
months before an  individual can make the time to attend training , let alone schedule specific 
auditing assignments.  
Given the ex tensive prefatory steps needed to create  a mandato ry climate reporting 
architecture of the magnitude envisioned under the Proposal , the SEC ’s proposal  to initiate 
reporting for FY 2024 is not only unreasonable, but also  likely impossible for many registrants.

21 The Proposal  would impose significant rewriti ng of issuer disclosure controls and 
procedures, disclosure vetting and governance practices and timelines, and increase the 
employee - and financial -resources tied to sam e, the last of which we have discussed in other 
portions of this letter.  Public issue rs operate under detailed, highly cadenced processes for 
vetting material items, issues, events, and risks for public disclosure. Adapting to the proposed 
rule will, for many companies, necessitate a significant and perhaps wholesale rewrite of those 
internal processes and a resetting (or acceleration) of the timeline for engaging with supply chain 
constituents and third -party consultants, auditors and other service provid ers.  In sum, the 
Commission has historically taken a much narrower approach to addres sing social issues through 
disclosure, and we wish to underscore the considerable changes to internal systems, policies, 
procedures, and practices the rule will necessita te and the equally significant diversion (away 
from day -to-day business operations) of  officer and director attention such efforts will require.  
The requirement to include expanded climate information in annual S-K and S -X filings 
is also unreasonable and inconsistent with the practical constraints companies face in p reparing 
these filings .  The March dead line for the filings is entirely impracticable given the time that will 
be needed to gather data, compile GHG emissions, report and provide limited/reasonable 
assurance . It also ignores the need to accommodate  ongoing merger s and acquisiti on activities 
and the challenges that will be required to operationalize complex requirements at newly  
acquired facilities.56  
H. The Commission  adopts  a false equivalence between the voluntary ESG 
disclosures and practices of some companie s and economy -wide m andatory 
requirements  
Throughout the Proposal , the Commission alludes to the maturity of the voluntary 
climate reporting marketplace to downplay the significance of the mandated requirements.57 This 
presumption of transferability and scalability of existing  reporting framework s across the whole 
economy is misplaced .  
The voluntary disclosure space includes an incredibly diverse set of frameworks and 
metrics that meet the unique needs of different sectors or audience. These frameworks (like 
SASB or GRI) have developed multiple versions of their standards over the years. Ongoing 
efforts to develop and consolidate various voluntary frameworks illustrate the complexity of 
different industrial sectors, individual companies, and regional geography that have made ev en 
the most flexible frameworks difficult to align .  
The Proposal acknowledge s that “[a]n International Sustainability Standards Board 
(ISSB) has recently been created, which is expected to issue global sustainability standards, 
 
56 With respect to Request for I nformation #180, Proposal at 21040, transi tional relieve will be an absolute 
necessity.  
57 See, e.g. , Proposal at 21346  (“We have modeled the proposed disclosure rules in part on the TCFD 
disclosure framework. Building on the TCFD framework should enable companies to leverage the framework with 
which many investors and issuers are already familiar , which should help to mitigate both the complian ce burden for 
issuers and any burdens faced by investors in analyzing and comparing the new proposed disclosures.”)    
22 including climate -related d isclosure standards .”58 As part of that process, the ISSB will look to 
consol idate multiple third -party disclosure frameworks  developed by SASB/VRF, the Climate 
Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), Climate Disclosure Project (CDP), International 
Integrated Re porting Council (IIRC), Task force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD), and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) . That consolidated system is expected to 
encourag e a more flexible approach known as the “building block” disclosure strategy rather 
than seeking entirely standardized reporting  as reflected in the Proposal .  
The proposed rule goes the other way, proposing a one-size-fits-all standard without the 
flexib ility, deliberation, or expertise provided through the evolving consensus process . Indeed, 
despite assertions that the rule would promote consistency and integration across industries and 
frameworks, t he Proposal  essentially picks one framework and runs wi th it, citing the TCFD 
framework 247 times without ever mentioning the building block  approach currently under 
development within the voluntary disclosure community .  
It will be difficult to establish a singular “gold -standard” no matter how narrow the sco pe 
or specificity  of the disclosure due to the sheer diversity of different operationa l contexts.  The 
context surrounding a disclosure can heavily influence the actual impact, if any, on the financial 
health of the disclosing company. These issues, among o thers, have made it extremely difficult 
to assess disclosures across varying sectors, companies, or regions, or find consistent approaches 
for validation. Leading disclosure efforts (such as the ISSB), are still unable to provide guidance 
around assuring n on-financial disclosures or certify ing to the use of their standards. Currently, 
consu mers of non -financial data have discussed ESG’s current state as “equal parts Art and 
Science .”59 While this practice continues to evolve, the SEC  should be exceedingly careful not to 
and undermine efforts by the privat e, voluntary disclosure market  to addr ess these challen ging 
issues.  
Just as there is no one perfect climate reporting framework, there is no single approach to 
adapting a chosen frameworks to a company’s unique climate risk profile . Many ACC members  
and ot her registrants do use voluntary clima te reporting methodologies as a complement  to their 
SEC material risk climate risk disclosures , using sustainability reports and other non -filed public 
documents  to provide information of interest to a broad range of n on-financial stakeholders.  As 
such, an d by the design of the various voluntary reporting systems available to companies, 
reporters are not s ubject to the  rigid content, audit, attestation, and liability stand ards commonly 
applied to financial risk information.  
Mandating disclosure in SEC fili ngs would fundamentally change the nature of such 
programs , as well as the cost and complexity of the management systems needed to ensure 
compliance , including impact on conso lidated subsidiaries and equity affiliates . It would also 
take voluntary reporter s into uncharted waters.   
For example, t he organizations that developed the GHG Protocol (WBCSD and WRI) do 
not certify or audit disclosure against the GHG Protocol methodolog y. As a result, i t is very

23 difficult to validate consistent interpretation of the  GHG Protocol methodology across reporting 
companies  – one of the key justifications the SEC  offers for their approach. Adjudicating issues 
that companies will have i n applying the GHG Protocol or other methodologies to their specific 
organi zation is incre dibly resource intensive  – particularly if the default resolution method is 
federal enforcement or third -party litigation .  
I. The Proposal  could conflict with existing international reporting regimes . 
Any new financial disclosure requirements for climate ris k should be consistent with and 
be no broader than relevant climate provisions of international regulatory mandates in place or 
under development in trade partner jurisdictions . In addition to the evolving nature of the 
voluntary financial disclosure marke tplace, a number of key trading partners are in the  process of 
developing new disclosure requirements for climate and other ESG  considerations. The 
uncertainty caused by these developments create a significant risk that new, prescriptive US 
standards could  conflict with requirements developed in other jurisdictions. The Commission can 
reduce this risk by avoiding overly expansive and prescriptive requirements, and by focusing on  
financially -material disclosures.   
ACC supports the Commission’s decision to f ocus the proposed rule on climate -related 
considera tions rather than the broader realm of “ESG” factors, as that would only exacerbate the 
legal, jurisdictional, materiality, and practical concerns already in play under the current scope. 
Still, the level of detail required in the Proposal, as well as the short implementation timeframe, 
are likely to create inconsistencies between the US and foreign financial reporting regimes, 
undermining the SEC ’s stated goal of ensuring consistency and potentially discou raging 
companies from registering as U.S. companies.   
The Commission should ensure that the core content requirements provide the flexibility 
needed to  align with the policies being developed under the European Com mission’s  Corporate 
Sustainability Due Di ligence Directive, proposed by the European Commission in February 
2022,60 and the United Kingdom’s  Climate -Related Financial Disclosure Regulations . The 
effective date for any new requirements should be no earlier than the dates established  under the 
CSDD Directive , to allow companies affected by b oth to develop consistent and complementary 
response strategies.  
J. The proposed rule would discourage companies from accessing public markets, 
inhibiting capital formation and growth.  
Public capital markets are cr itical economic drivers, providing companie s with access to 
the capital required to expand , creat e jobs, allow members of the public to participate in wealth 
creation , and in many cases , encourage more sustainable , transparent, and well -governed 
 
60 See Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive proposed by the European Commission in 
February 2022 .    
24 economic activit ies.61 Yet, t he Commission acknowledges the Proposal could discourage 
companies from going public :  
[I]f compliance costs with the proposed rules are high, this could influence the 
marginal firm’s decision to exit public markets or refrain from going public in 
the firs t place in order to circumvent the disclosure requirements. Firms may 
choose this strategy if they believe the potential compliance costs from the 
proposed rules outweigh the benefits of being registered public company. 
Uptake of this avo idance strategy ma y widen the transparency gap between 
public and private firms, negatively affecting capital markets’ information 
efficiency, and potentially reduce the size of the stock market.62 
This would have the unintended result of encouraging compan ies to opt out of any of the 
govern ance obligations  – the opposite of its mission. This impact will be most significant for 
small companies that may need public funding the most, but which may be m ost sensitive to 
incurring sweeping new regulatory reportin g and oversight obligations.    
The Commission’s recognition of this risk reinforces the conclusion that the Proposal is 
focused on climate policy rather than investor protection  and capital invest ment . Yet, t he kinds 
of projects required to improve the en vironment – moving to renewable energy, investing in new 
technologies, etc., are among those most likely to require capital investments through public 
markets. Discouraging companies from going pub lic is antithetical to the SEC ’s mission and 
should be clea r evidence of regulatory overreach.  
K. The filing, audit , and attestation requirements are unreasonable and 
impracticable .  
The Commission  exacerbate s the adverse impact of the proposed rule by requiring that 
the information be filed with registration statem ents and financial statements , increasing the legal 
liability registrants face with respect to calculating and filing required information. The SEC has  
adequate authority to enforce against false, misleading, or inadequate disclosures without such 
obligati ons.63 The SEC  should eliminate the attestation requirements  in the proposed rule  for any 
expanded reporting requirements . 
The Commission’s justification for requiring filed rather than furnished disclosures  rely 
heavily on theoretical benefits that “may” o ccur:  
Another alternative would be to permit Scopes 1, 2,  and 3 emissions disclosures to be 
considered “furnished” instead of “filed,” which may limit the incremental risk of being 
 
61 Although SEC is not a covered execu tive branch agency and this rulemaking may not be subject to the 
express  requirements of OMB Circular A -4, the practices established thereunder constitute best practice for federal 
rulemakings , however,  and provide a minimum threshold for administrative procedure  in the context of such a 
complex and impactful rulemaking.  
62 Proposal at 21448 . 
63 See, e.g. , 17 C.F. R. Subpart A ( Manipulative and Deceptive Devices and Contrivances ); SEC, Division 
of Enforcement , Enforcement Manual  (November 28, 2017 ).   
25 held liable under Section 18 of the Exchange Act for these disclosures.  Th is may also 
benefit some registrants as their Scopes 1 an d 2 emissions disclosures would not be 
automatically incorporated into Securities Act registration statements and thereby not be 
subject to Section 11 liability. We note that this could have a lower incremental impact 
on Scope 3 emissions disclosures since  Scope 3 emissions disclosures are covered under 
a proposed safe harbor provision and hence already afforded other liability protections. 
However, reduced liability in general may lead to the applica ble disclosures being 
perceived as less reliable by inves tors, which could have adverse effects on registrants’ 
stock liquidity or costs of capital. For these reasons, the Commission is not proposing to 
permit emissions disclosures to be furnished at this time.64 
ACC  encourages the Commission to revisit its deci sion to mandate filing of requested 
information rather than furnishing as is currently the norm.  
L. The Commission’s economic analysis is incomplete and substantively flawed . 
We evaluated the SEC ’s econ omic analysis of its Proposal  against long -established 
feder al criteria for analysis of economically significant rules. Our review of the Commission’s 
economic analysis  reveals  significant deficiencies with the proposed rule , which are detailed 
below.  
1. The Commission fails to justify the need for the expansive information 
collection, analysis, and reporting requirements.  
The Commission  has developed guidance  on the conduct of economic analys is in SEC 
rulema kings . 65 This guidance “draw s on princ iples set for th in” Executive Order 12866 on 
regulatory review, Executive Order 13563  on improving regulation and regulatory review , and 
OMB Circular A -4, Circular A -4 (September 17, 2003 ) on regulatory analysis , and 
acknowledge s that statutory provisions and caselaw require the Commission to “consider 
efficiency, competition, and capital formation whenever it is engaged in rulemaking and is 
required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public 
interest .”66  These authorities “expre ssly call for consideration of several broad economic issues 
in addition to the protection of investors , including the impact that any rule promulgated under 
that Act would have on competition .67  
From a financial policy perspective, the need for the rule  is questionable. It is clear from 
the economic analysis that there is no material failure of private markets  as defined b y Circular 
 
64 Proposal at 21449  
65 SEC, Memorandum on Current Guidance on Economic Analysis in SEC Rulemaking s (March 16, 2012 ) 
(Economic Analysis G uidance) . 
66 Id. at 4.  
67 Id. Executive Order 12866 states that ""Federal agencies should promulgate only such regulations as are 
required by law, are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary by compelling need, such as mate rial 
failures of private markets to protect or improve the health and safety of the public, the environment, or the well -
being of the American people .”   
26 A-4 (externality, information asymmetry, or market power ).68 The Com mission is correct by not 
identifying asymmetric informati on as a market failure. The amount of climate -relevant 
information available to investors continues to increase year after year, as the Commission notes. 
Although it is apparent that a subset of inv estors (ESG investors) would like to have better 
informati on on climate -related risks, this interest falls short of a compelling public need  or the 
standard of “materiality” under the reasonable investor test . 
Cost benefit analysis is a well -accepted polic y tool, regularly used in federal rulemaking 
involving env ironmental, social, and financial matters.  Circular A -4 recommends that regulators, 
“to the extent feasible, . . . quantify all potential incremental benefits and costs.” It also 
recommends moneti zing quantified benefits and costs. Such a comparison and di scussion is 
central to regulatory analysis  and should be included in the economic analysis as an 
economically significant rule under EO 12866 and a major rulemaking under the Congressional 
Review Act.69 
While the  proposed rule does offer a partial estimate of the rule’s costs in its Paperwork 
Reduction Act (PRA) analysis , it is incomplete and fails to quantify and monetize the benefits in 
any meaningful way , preventing a reasonable assessment of the rule’s overall  value.   
2. The Commission failed to fully quant ify and monetize incremental costs to 
registrants and unregistered entities.  
According to Commissio n guida nce, a rule’s economic analysis “should consider 
compliance costs, direct costs, and indirect costs .” For exampl e:  
• Compliance costs “may include in -house personnel time and resources and 
outside accounting or legal fees .”  
• Direct costs “could include costs arising from intended changes to the behavior 
of regulated firms or persons in response to the reporting requirement.  
• Indirect costs “could includ e costs arising from changes to the behavior of 
regulated firms or persons beyond those that the rule was intended to achieve, or 
costs arising from changes in be havior by parties other than regulated firms or 
persons …,[O]ther types of indirect costs can i nclude, but are not limited to:  the 
 
68 Circular A -4 identifies three market failures: externality, asymmetric  information, and market power. The 
problem identified by the Commission —lack of perfect information to a subset of investors —does not rise to the 
level of a material failure of markets, nor does it constitute an information asymmetry.  
69 The CRA defines a  major rule as “any rule that the Administrator of the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs [OIRA] of the Of fice of Management and Budget [OMB] finds has resulted in or is likely to 
result in —(A) an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or m ore; (B) a major increase in costs or prices for 
consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local governme nt agencies, or geographic regions; or (C) 
significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of 
United States -based enterprises to compete with foreign -based enterprises in domestic and export m arkets. The term 
does not include any rule promulgated under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the amendments made by 
that Act.” 5 U.S.C. §804(2).    
27 distributional and competitive effects of the rule;  negative collateral 
consequences, such as the potential misu se of newly created rights; [and]  a 
misallocation of resources resulting from regulatory arbitrage (race to the 
bottom).70 
In the current proposal, a ll such costs are triggered under the rule but few beyond the 
most basic compliance costs are incorpo rated into the Paperw ork Reduction A ct analysis  or 
quantified in any meaningful  way.  
Even with these omissions , the cost of the rule is substantial .  The PRA analysis  
calculates an incremental annual reporting burden of 24.7 million hours at an annual cost of 
$6.38 billion  and this estimate most likely significantly underestimates the actual  costs of the 
rule. The Proposal acknowledges that this estima te may understate th e rule’s total economic 
impact by disregarding a number of indirect costs:71  
[T]he propos ed rules may result in additional litigation risk sin ce the propos ed climate-
related disclosures may be new and unfamiliar to many registrants.952 The propos ed 
rules would significantly expand the type and amount of  information registrants are 
required to provide about climate-related risks. Registrants unfamiliar preparing these 
disclosures may face significant un certainty and nov el compliance challenges. To the 
extent this leads to inadvertent non -compliance, registrants may face additional exposu re 
to litigation or  enforcement action.72 
In addition to these acknowledged impacts, the rule, as proposed, will have a direct 
material financial impact not  only on companies listed on the national securities exchanges  
(including equity affiliates) , but also on privately -owned and operated businesses that are beyond 
the Commis sion’s regulatory mandate. The requisite disclosure obligations will create a daisy 
chain of probing inquiries and disclosure and data assurance obligations up and down the 
chemistry industry’s value chain, regardless of whether an industry participant is listed on a 
national securities exchange, and will introduce new sources of cost and  risk to ACC member 
companies.  
The material adverse financial impact will not be isolated to the expense side of the 
income statement. Private chemistry compan ies may be u nable or unwilling to provide the sort of 
access and information required by registr ant companies in order to make the mandated 
disclosure . This could lead to unintended and harmful constriction in the chemistry industry and 
beyond, and cause direct financ ial harm ( i.e., the loss of business, the shuttering of the business, 
increased liti gation risk , and disruption of supply chains across the economy ).  
 
70 Economic Analysis Guidance at 11. 
71 Proposal at 21443  (“In addition to the  direct costs of  preparing climate-related disclosures, the propos ed 
rules could also lead to indirect costs.”) 
72 Id. at 214444.    
28 The Commission should include these costs in its economic analysis, along with a 
reasonable estimate of the signi ficant costs the rule will impose on non -public companies within 
the registr ant’s value chain, in its analysis of paperwork burden under the PRA.  
3. The proposal’s baseline and alternatives analysis are insufficient . 
It is unclear whether the proposed requireme nts would have any material impact on how 
publicly traded firms manag e their own GHG emissions.  The SEC EA Guidance recommends 
the establishment of a baseline that can be used to estimate the incremental costs and benefits of 
the Proposal .73 Specifically, economic “this normally will be a ‘no action ’ baseline: what the 
world will  be like if the proposed rule is not adopted. ”74 In its analysis, however, the 
Commission fails to provide any quantifiable estimate of the benefits to investors from the 
additional informatio n, or any net incentive for registrants to reduce GHG emissions c ompared to 
the baseline. Indeed, the proposal fails to provide any conclusive evidence that the requirements 
to provide any net benefits to investors or the environment.  
The Commission also fails to provide any alternatives significantly less stringent tha n its 
preferred alternative.  Circular A -4 recommends identification of a “manageable number” of 
alternatives  that differ in terms of stringency. According to Circular A -4: You should study 
alternative levels of stringency to understand more fully the relat ionship between stringency and 
the size and distribution of benefits and costs among different groups.  
Unfortunately, the 15 alternatives vary only slightly from the stringency of its Proposal . 
Essentially, the Commission is seeking comment on a narrow ran ge of alternatives, all of which 
are relatively stringent. Where are the alternatives that represent th e most incremental change 
from the status quo? None are reflected in its 15 alternatives. The commission should reduce the 
number of alternatives while a dding one or two imposing a low incremental burden from the 
baseline (status quo).     
As noted previous ly, the commission should estimate the incremental cost of each 
alternative. The PRA analysis already conducted by the Commission could be used to quanti fy 
the incremental cost of each element of the Proposal  and this information can be aggregated to 
estim ate the incremental cost of each alternative, where the alternatives span a wider range of 
relative stringency.   
M. Conclusion and Recommendations  
ACC membe rs are leaders in the worldwide chemistry industry and face extraordinary 
international competition thr oughout the value chain. They are important and committed partners 
in economy -wide fight to reduce carbon emissions. Finally, they support efforts to pro mote 
informed investment in public capital markets.  
 
73 SEC EA Guidance at 4.  
74 Id. at 6.   
29 For reasons described above, we believe the rule w ould undermine rather than advance 
the Commissions mission and stated goals.  We urge the Commission to withdraw the Proposal, 
designated it as an Advanc ed Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or, at minimum, extend the 
comment period to 180 days to allow additi onal direct consultation with affected industries and 
traditional investors. Absent such action, ACC recommends the following : 
• Limit quantitative s cope 1 emissions reporting to companies already subject to 
federal reporting , allowing narrative disclosure of  financiall y material emis sions for 
all others : Only companies sub ject to existing greenhouse gas reporting requirements 
under 40 C.F.R. part 98  should be required to provide  emissions data . For registrants with 
emissions falling below this threshold, manda tory scope  1 reporting should be  limited to 
a narrative description , to the extent financially ma terial .  
• Limit s cope 2 emissions reporting  to narrativ e desc riptions  of material financially 
material categories : The SEC should eliminate all requi rements fo r quantitative 
reporting of scope 2 emissions . Manda tory s cope 2 emissions reporting should be limited 
to a narrative description , to the extent financi ally material . 
• Limit scope 3 emissions reporting to qualitative narrative description of financially 
material categories : The SEC should eliminate all requirement s for quantification of 
scope 3 emissions, and limit scope 3 assessment and reporting to a nar rative disclosure of 
specific categories of scope 3 emissions within the supply and value chain where such 
emissions present specific sources of material financial risk.  
• Extend effective date of all compliance de adlines by at least 3 years : Extend the 
effective date of the rule by 3 years to allow time for registrants and members of the 
scope 2 and 3 supply chain to develop systems  for information collection, analysis, 
validation, and reporting within the legal and liability framework of SEC filings.  
• Exemp t proprietary management and strateg ic information : Eliminate requirements 
to report on confidential business information and competitive strategy, including but not 
limited to internal climate risk and impact assessment methodologies, internal risk 
analys is, comparison, and mitigation policies, carbon pricing policies, details of 
proprietary transition plans, including poten tial new products, services, and suppliers.  
• Eliminate the zip-code reporting requirement  for any  climate information : Eliminate 
requi rement s to report on facility locations at the zip -code level, limiting areas reporting 
to the state -level  or higher , and only where directly material to financial perform ance and 
risk.  
• Retain focus on narrative disclosure prop ortionate with other risks  and allow 
supp lemental information to be furnished in a se parate stand -alone report : Narrative 
reporting on climate risks and impacts should be included in applicable registration 
sections used for other risk factors at the same level of detail and material ity. Any 
supplemental information propo sed in the amendments beyond that traditionally r equired  
for other risk factors should be supplied under a furnished standard  as part of a separate   
30 stand -alone report required no more than annually  after the d eadline for S -X and S -K 
reports.   
• Eliminate a udit and attestation  requirements for any expanded disclosure 
requirements : Eliminate any attestation requirement for supplementary disclosure 
information required under the amended  standard, relying instead on the SEC ’s 
traditional oversight of furnished information.  
• Eliminate line -item reporting on financial statements and retain the five percent  de 
minimis threshold  for any financial reporting . Eliminate requirement to estimate and 
report climate -related impacts at a line -item level and raise the reporting threshold un der 
S-X from one percent to a minimum of five percent .  
• Expand the rule’s economic impact analysis to address  proprietary, indirect , and 
third -party impacts  and costs : Analyze the economic impact  and costs of contract 
negotiation , information collection, data management, analysis, reporting , and legal 
review  that will be required  by domestic and foreign members of each registrant ’s supply 
chain and downstream value chain  to support compliance with the br oad scope 3 
reporting mandate and other requirements. Also quantify  other indirect costs  ident ified 
within the NPRM including “heightened litigation risk and the potential disclosure of 
proprietary information ,” the potential loss and/or dislocation of sup pliers or customers, 
and potential for increased cost of capital .75  
 
 
75 See NPRM at 214 58 (“a firm may choose  to change  some  suppliers  or disengage  with certain  clients  
due to the effect  that they may have  on the firm’s  Scope  3 emissions.  This  may be particularly  relevant  for 
certain  financial  institutions  that are impacted  by their portfolio  firms’  emissions  or climate -related  risks.  These  
financial institutions may be less willing  to extend credit  to firms  for which  it is difficult  to measure  climate  risk 
exposure  information,  potentially  increasing  the cost of capital  for these  firms. ”); id. 2144 9 (“costs may include 
the revelation of trade secrets, the disclosure of profitable customers  and markets, or the exposure of operating 
weakness to competing firms, unions, regulators, investors, customers or suppliers. These costs are commo nly 
referred to as ‘‘proprietary costs.’ )” THE BUSINESS

Supplemental Comments by the Sierra Club on Pr oposed Climate Risk Disclosur e Rule
and ESG Disclosur e Rule (File Nos. S7-10-22 and S7-17-22)
The Sierra Club appreciates the opportunity to submit these supplemental comments on the
Securities & Exchange Commission’ s proposed climate risk disclosure rule and proposed ESG
disclosure rule.
1
Our purpose is to highlight recent
developments that strengthen the case for
comprehensive GHG emissions disclosure requirements in both rules.
The global transition from carbon-intensive sources of ener gy to zero-carbon and low-carbon
sources, ar guably the lar gest capital reallocation in world history , will soon reach a key
milestone. In its October 2022 annual
World Ener gy
Outlook
, t
he International Ener gy Agency
anticipates that global GHG emissions from ener gy
will peak
in 2025
, thanks to massively
increased government spending on clean ener gy technologies in response to Russia’ s invasion of
Ukraine. Just a month earlier ,
Credit Suisse
pointed
to the Inflation Reduction Act as one of the
key drivers of the accelerated transition away from carbon-intensive ener gy sources, concluding
that the IRA  “will have a profound ef fect across industries in the next decade and beyond” and
could ultimately shape the direction of the American economy .
1
Sierra Club’s initial
comments on the climate risk
disclosure rule
were submitted on June 16, 2022;
our 
comments on the ESG disclosure rule
were submitted
on August 16, 2022.
Major questions remain about whether reductions in global GHG emissions will take place at a
pace suf ficient to avoid the
irreversible tipping
points
that threaten to destabilize the financial
system. However , there is no doubt that investors face enormous challenges navigating through
the ener gy transition. Comprehensive GHG emissions disclosures from public companies will be
essential to help investors assess such companies’  exposure to the financial impacts of  the
energy transition and to enable them to allocate capital according to their risk-return preferences.
Investors need pr otection fr om concealment of climate risk by companies unpr epared for the
transition and making emissions r eduction pledges unsupported by financial statements
Without standardized climate disclosure requirements encompassing all GHG emissions,
investors face a significant risk that registrants will not adequately inform them about the
climate-related financial risk they are facing. An October 2022 Carbon Tracker Initiative study
of climate risk disclosure,
Still Flying Blind - The
Absence of Climate Risk in Financial
Reporting
, highlights the major problems arising under
today’ s sustainability disclosure regime,
which combines voluntary reporting and poorly-enforced regulatory requirements. It reviews the
2021 financial statements of 134 multinational companies responsible for roughly 80% of
corporate industrial GHG emissions - those facing the greatest transition risk - and finds that
98% did not provide suf ficient evidence that they considered the material impacts of the ener gy
transition and other climate-related matters when preparing their financial statements, despite
regulatory requirements to do so.
Many of the companies in the
Still Flying Blind
study
made net-zero or similar emissions
reduction pledges in their annual reports and other corporate communications. Yet researchers
were unable to find consistency between those communications and the financial statements. For
example, only three companies provided sensitivities of their productive asset values to net-zero
scenarios; similarly , financial statements did not appear to be using assumptions and estimates,
such as estimated lives of productive assets or projected commodity prices, that would reflect the
net-zero pledges. The study finds that such inconsistencies, which were greater in U.S.
disclosures than in non-U.S. disclosures, may represent evidence of greenwashing.
Comments submitted in response to the Commission’ s proposed climate risk disclosure rule
show that investors almost uniformly believe that they need Scope 3 emission disclosures to
evaluate transition risk. In an
October 2022 review
of comments on the proposed climate risk
rule
, Ceres finds that 97% of institutional investors
support the SEC’ s proposed Scope 3
disclosures, roughly the same level of support as for Scope 1 and 2 disclosures (99%).
Investors have been calling for improved GHG emissions disclosure from public companies in
proxy votes as well, supporting a range of shareholder resolutions that would either directly
encourage companies to disclose emissions or indirectly encourage such disclosure through
2establishment of emissions reduction tar gets or transition plans (which imply the need for
emissions disclosures to track progress). According to a
Sustainable Investments Institute
analysis prepared for its subscribers, during the 2020-22 proxy seasons, investor votes on
proposals to strengthen emissions disclosures and related proposals received the following levels
of support:
○
Adopt GHG emissions reduction tar gets: 43.6%
○
Adopt net-zero GHG emissions reduction tar gets: 68.5%
○
Adopt Scope 3 tar gets and/or reduce Scope 3 emissions: 34.8%
○
Report on net-zero GHG emissions reduction tar gets: 57.2%
○
Adopt Paris-compliant strategy to cut GHG emissions: 26.4%
○
Report on GHG emissions tar gets: 69.9%
○
Report on methane emissions/reduction tar gets: 98.0%
This three-year record of voting behavior shows intense interest among shareholders in obtaining
GHG emissions information. Failure by companies to provide such information has spurred lar ge
numbers to cast their votes for greater disclosure.
Limiting mandated emissions disclosur es to Scopes 1 and 2 would exacerbate the pr oblem of
undisclosed outsour ced emissions
Some commenters have suggested that to address this transparency problem, the Commission
should require Scope 1 and 2 emissions disclosures but not Scope 3 disclosures. This ar gument
ignores the problem of outsourced GHG emissions, in which companies assign responsibilities
for carbon-intensive operations to third parties that act lar gely outside of regulatory scrutiny . In
“
Outsourcing Climate Change
”
(January 2022), Dai et
al. find that “U.S. firms outsource part of
their pollution to global suppliers to evade their emissions responsibilities” and such emissions
outsourcing “appears to be a substitute for pollution abatement and innovation in green
technology .” According to the authors, if forward-looking investors had information about these
practices, they would likely respond by “seek[ing] compensation for holding stocks of carbon
outsourcers associated with more substantial carbon risks.” The authors do not address investors
lacking
information about outsourced emissions, but
the implication is that the companies failing
to disclose this information would incur a lower cost of capital, at the expense of those investors.
The Commission proposes to require disclosures about recent shifts of operations that result in
Scope 1 emissions being recategorized as Scope 3 emissions. However , the substantial financial
incentive for misleading investors about Scope 3 emissions (the savings both from avoiding
regulatory scrutiny of emissions and from paying the full climate risk-adjusted cost of capital)
could motivate registrants to take steps to evade this requirement. In any case, such a brief and
time-limited disclosure  would not provide the comprehensive GHG emissions picture that
3investors need. The common practice of outsourcing emissions, with poor transparency for
investors, is yet another justification for the SEC to create a mandatory and comprehensive GHG
emissions disclosure regime.
Investors need mandatory Scope 3 disclosur es to evaluate and compar e companies’  management
of transition risk
Financial institutions
Concerns about GHG emissions and transition risks faced by carbon-intensive industries are not
limited to institutional investors. Policies and pledges to restrict financing for the
oil and gas
and
coal
industries have been adopted by ever -increasing
numbers of banks and insurers. In just the
past two months, financial industry leaders such as
Deutsche Bank
and
Munich Re
have adopted
oil and gas financing restrictions and the
Royal Bank
of Canada
has adopted coal financing
restrictions.
Moreover , Scope 3 disclosures of financed emissions should not be left to the discretion of
financial institutions making their own judgments about materiality to investors
.
Financed
emissions represent 700 times the operational emissions
of companies in the financial industry .
Industry leaders, working through the
Partnership
for Carbon Accounting Financials
have shown
that disclosure of these Scope 3 emissions is very feasible, despite concerns about data quality
and availability , using reasonable estimates and disclosures of data quality scores. Disclosures of
these emissions is essential for protecting investors from hidden transition risk, meeting their
own commitments as well as their fiduciary responsibilities.
Manufactur ers
The manufacturing industry is another one in which key actors are increasingly taking action on
transition risk. New incentives for clean ener gy and construction materials such as those
provided by the Inflation Reduction Act provide a competitive advantage for companies prepared
to reduce GHG emissions in their manufacturing supply chains and represent significant
financial risks for less-prepared competitors. The Inflation Reduction Act alone provides
$50
billion in tax credits, grants and loans
for clean
manufacturing, including: wind, solar and battery
manufacturing (s. 13502), electric vehicle manufacturing (s. 50142 and 50143), clean hydrogen
production (s. 13204), advanced ener gy technology manufacturing (s. 13501), industrial
emissions reduction (s. 50161), and low-carbon construction materials (s. 601 12, 601 16, 60503,
60504, 60506,. 70006). These federal incentives are expected to spur sizable investments of
private capital. In just the first few months following the IRA ’s enactment,
$28 billion in
investments in U.S. clean ener gy manufacturing
have
been announced.
Credit Suisse anticipates
that “with subsidized green financing and the multiplier ef fect on federal grants/loans [from the
4Inflation Reduction Act], the total public plus private financing could reach ~$1.7 trillion over
ten years.”
Some of the IRA ’s financial incentives, such as those of fered for manufacturing of hydrogen and
construction materials, are available only to those that can demonstrate a low carbon footprint.
Companies that can compete on reducing Scope 3 emissions will therefore have a tremendous
advantage in obtaining these incentives. Investors have a critical need for Scope 3 emissions
disclosures to evaluate companies’  preparedness for this new policy landscape and to make
comparisons among companies feasible.
A similar imperative to GHG emissions in the manufacturing supply chain is provided by the
EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism
(CBAM), which
imposes a carbon price on imports
of products from the cement, aluminum, fertilizer , electricity , and iron and steel sectors based on
their carbon intensity . Scope 3 disclosures will be essential to enable investors to evaluate which
companies are minimizing CBAM-related risks by lining up low-emissions suppliers in the
cement, aluminum, fertilizer , electricity , and iron/steel sectors.
With virtually every automobile manufacturer rapidly shifting its focus away from internal
combustion engines to building electric vehicles in response to EV  incentives from Congress and
EV mandates from the European Union and beyond, some are now preparing for CBAM and
related regulations that reward GHG reductions in the EV  supply chain. For example, in October
2022,
Ford announced a tentative agreement with Tata
Steel
in which Tata committed to provide
fossil fuel-free steel for Ford’ s electric vehicles beginning in 2030. According to Ford,
“improvements within our supply chain are key , and with the use of carbon neutral steel we will
take a major step towards lowering the CO2 footprint of our vehicles."" Investors need greater
visibility into all manufacturers’  Scope 3 emissions to evaluate their ability to compete with
companies in their sectors that will be winning market share based on their reduction of these
emissions.
Other Sectors
The investor need for Scope 3 disclosures extends far beyond the financial and manufacturing
industries, of course. In an
April 2022 technical
note
, CDP  measured Scope 3 emissions’
percentage of overall emissions in sectors with a high impact on the ener gy transition and
produced the following table:
5As this table shows, Scope 3 emissions represent the majority of emissions in many
carbon-intensive sectors. Some companies are implementing forward-looking strategies to
decarbonize operations and reduce transition risk, while others are unable or unwilling to prepare
for the transition. Investors need Scope 3 emissions disclosures to help evaluate and compare
performance on this critical measure of financial health.
Requiring compr ehensive emissions disclosur es would contribute to the goal of harmonizing U.S.
disclosur e standar ds with standar ds in other jurisdictions
In October 2022, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB), established in 2021 to
respond to investor demand for high-quality , globally-comparable sustainability information,
announced
that it had tentatively agreed that Scope
3 disclosures would be required under its
climate risk disclosure standard, due to be finalized in early 2023. It identified the remaining
Scope 3-related question - how to address issuer concerns about data quality and availability -
and suggested that delayed implementation, relief for smaller reporting companies and a safe
harbor from liability were under consideration.
2
Given
that the ISSB climate risk disclosure
standard will likely become mandatory in lar ge parts of the world after it is finalized by the ISSB
and reviewed by financial regulators, the Commission should take note of this important progress
on Scope 3 emissions disclosure. By requiring Scope 3 emissions disclosures, the Commission
would greatly assist both investors and issuers with harmonizing disclosures to the Commission
with those that will soon be made to other regulators. For companies, such harmonization would
reduce the global costs of disclosure. For investors, it would greatly simplify evaluation and
comparison of companies.
2
An
ISSB staf f analysis of comments
received on the
draft climate risk standard shows strong 
investor support for Scope 3 disclosures and provides important insights on how issuer concerns
about data quality and availability could be addressed.
6
In September 2022, Morningstar released an
analysis
of twenty asset manager and institutional
investor comments on the draft ISSB proposals and found that investors were nearly unanimous
in supporting mandatory Scopes 1 and 2 disclosures, while views were mixed on Scope 3
disclosures. No investor questioned the importance of comprehensive emissions disclosures for
investors to evaluate transition risk. Nearly half expressed the view that such disclosures are
necessary for investors to develop a full picture of transition risk exposure and to evaluate
investment risks and opportunities. Others focused on the problems of data quality and
availability , arguing for reporting companies to be allowed to selectively disclose based on a
materiality assessment or proposing delayed implementation.
Meanwhile, financial regulators appear to be moving forward with mandatory Scope 3
disclosures. In August 2022, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG)
concluded its
consultation
on a host of proposed sustainability
reporting standards called for by
the EU’ s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, including a proposal to require Scope 3
emissions disclosures. Similarly , in June 2022, the UK government completed its
consultation
on
a climate risk disclosure requirement, part of its Greening Finance Strategy , inviting comments
on incorporation of Scope 3 emissions disclosures. Both the EU and UK are expected to finalize
their standards, with some version of a Scope 3 disclosure mandate, in the next several months.
These regulatory initiatives are moving forward because private sector leaders have
demonstrated the feasibility of Scope 3 disclosures, despite data quality and availability
challenges, over the course of two decades of voluntary emissions disclosures. Voluntary Scope 3
emissions disclosures have gained momentum in recent years. A
June 2022 white paper
from
World Resources Institute and Concordia University finds that the number of companies
reporting Scope 3 emissions in the public CDP  dataset increased from 936 companies in 2010 to
3,317 companies in 2021. In most industry sectors, two-thirds of companies or more reported
Scope 3 emissions in 2021; the highest percentage was in the power generation sector , where
84% of companies voluntarily reported Scope 3 emissions. This experience shows that Scope 3
disclosures are already viable. Moreover , the rate of learning is inevitably accelerating now that
the number of Scope 3 practitioners has scaled. This learning - including how to make reasonable
estimates where high-quality data are unavailable - will greatly accelerate once the SEC sets a
deadline for mandatory disclosures and once registrants and data analytics advisors begin
preparing for the new era.
The Commission should issue a final climate risk rule with mandatory Scope 3 emissions
disclosure. By aligning with other standard-setters and building on private sector experience with
Scope 3 disclosures, it will reduce global compliance costs of multinational companies while
simplifying the work of investors in evaluating and comparing those companies.
Thank you for your consideration of these comments.

We are writing to express our strong support for the SEC in  finalizing Rule S7 -10-22. We’ve 
previously commented ( here) but today we want to sharpen our message: Climate -related 
disclosures are critical to all investors , especially individual investors whose survival in the 
market depends on fair and open access to securities information.   
As an emerging climate data and analytics company servi ng investors and risk managers, we  are 
steely -eyed  in our belief that climate -aware investing is as important to investors as GAAP -
aware investing. Efficient markets depend on exactly this kind of information . 
We acknowledge that many public companies  toda y confront real obstacles  — and  miss 
important opportunities  — when it comes to providing  reliable and indicative climate data. But 
these problems can be solved and are in fact being solved, and these opportunities can be seized. 
The market needs only the force of regulation to focus action and embed this critical investment 
data in statements and disclosures.  
Here's what’s needed:  
• Scope 1, Scope 2 and especially S cope 3 e missions:  This is the category of data that 
most directly connects company performance to climate impact, and conversely — and most important to an informed  investor — climate’s impact on a company’s performance.  
• Verification and validation:  Double -point authentication using top- down climate 
scenario analysis  to stress- test company -reported  data, whose quality is typically 
inconsistent . Requiring a secondary evaluation by a qualified independent entity has long 
been the norm in the bond market and  is warranted in the climate -data arena.  
• Forward -forecasted reporting at the company level:  How climate -related risks, 
including known risks and risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the business or consolidated financial statements, may affect th at business in the short, 
medium or long term.  
We invite  the SEC  to join us in asking critical questions like these : Do investors deserve to know 
the factors that impact the climate sensitivity of their holdings? Would this knowledge, priced in over time, have blunted the impact of inflation and energy shocks on portfolios and led to generally more resilient markets?   
The SEC's charter to protect investors makes it mission -critical to hold the line. Disclosure of 
climate -related data is necessary for a level playing field. Strong climate reporting requirements 
are not just good for  the world but good for investors.  
It’s often been observed that Europe ’s markets have led the way on climate. This is true even 
though U.S. capital markets — efficient, transparent, powerful — are in all other ways the world’s acknowledged leader . We strongly believe that by c ementing Rule S7- 10-22, the SEC 
will position the U.S. for  the next generation of global capital markets leadership.

November 1, 2022  
 
Dear  Chair Gensler , 
We, the undersigned 75 asset  owners, managers and service providers representing over $1.7 trillion  
in assets under management  and advisement , write  to urge the  Commission to finalize the 
proposed rule “The Enhancem ent and Standardization of Climate -Related Disclosures for 
Investors  (S7-10-22)”.1 Since the proposal in April, the need for standardized climate -related 
disclosures has only become more pressing . 
The SEC’s proposed rule presents a necessary baseline  of in formation  need ed to fully account 
for climate -related risks across investment  portfolios . In the absence of SEC acti on, investors continue 
to devote resources to obtain this information from  issuer s.2 The SEC’s proposal would establish a 
minimum set of climate -related information presented in a consistent, comparable and standardized 
way. Without this baseline, investors will continue to struggle to gather and assess this information 
through numerous, voluntary regimes.  
To aid the utility of the prop osed r ule, we urge the SEC  not to w eaken the proposal by  walking 
back emission  disclosures.  Since the introduction of the proposed rule, the threat posed by climate 
change has become clearer  and the transition to a low -carbon economy has accelerated –includ ing 
with Congress ional passage of the  Inflation Reduction Act  (IRA) .  
In order to consider the full implications of climate change and the transition , investors require reliable 
and comparable climate -related information from issuers. This includes greenhouse ga s emissions 
data, in the form of Scopes 1, 2, and 3  emissions . At present, company disclosure of these financially 
material emissions is limited,  inconsistent, incomparable, or a mix of all three.  This lack of decision -
useful disclosure  increases costs for  investors in terms of :  
• Direct costs of sourcing providers of this information to estimate or consolidate data into a 
usable form . 
• Stewardship -related costs for both companies and investors (as more frequent company 
engagement will be required to understa nd and interpret data to inform ownership decisions).  
• Opportunity costs from investors  operating  in US financial markets as they  seek to optimize  
allocation decisions limited by the  lack of consistent and reliable data .  
Furthermore, rather than weaken an y final rulemaking, the SEC should consider strengthening 
the final rule’s alignment with climate reporting trends in the UK, France, the rest of the EU and 
those advancing  globally , to ensure the data needs of investors are fully met . This is the most 
efficient and practical way to protect investors from the growing risks stemming from climate change.  
The PRI’s recent comparative analysis of the SE C’s proposed rule, the International Sustainability 
 
1 PRI’s original comment to the SEC is available here  
2 See for example Climate Actio n 100+   
 Standard Board’s Exposure Drafts, and the European Sustain ability Reporting Standard’s Exposure 
Drafts, reveals areas for improvement regarding the global alignment of proposed climate -related 
disclosures .3 This includes  data points needed by investors for decision -making such as Scope 3 
greenhouse gas emissions , where significant,  and industry -specific metrics.4  
Finalizing the proposed rule is the best route to provide investors with the certainty and transparency 
need ed to fully consider climate -related risks in investment decision making  and to enable institut ional 
investors to full y act in the interests of their beneficiaries .

 Even fewer companies, just 16%, disclosed the resilience of their strategies under different 
climate-related scenarios.5 Investors rely on company emissions data and transition plans in order 
to make prudent investment decisions and assess climate-related financial risk. Companies that 
make net-zero or climate-related commitments must disclose this information in order to provide 
investors a clear picture of the company’s efforts and progress towards their climate goals. This 
evident, widespread lack of company disclosures underscores the importance of the Proposed 
Rule. 
 
Clarifying proportionality of transition plan and Scope 3 disclosure requirements  
 
 Through investor engagement and media coverage, we are aware of oppos ition  perspectives 
regarding  transition plan and Scope 3 disclosure requirements.  We believe that the opposition to these 
requirements is based on an unfounded distortion of how we understand the Commission would apply 
these requirements. We suggest that the Commission address the concerns posed  by opposition to the 
rules through guidance on how the proposed rules would be implemented.  
 Scope 3 disclosure requirements  
 We stand by our prior comment that mandatory Scope 3 disclosure is appropriate, and that it should 
not be built around an assessment of materiality. Our prior comments of June 16, 2022 urged mandatory 
Scope 3 disclosure, not conditioned on materiality, and suggested that the Commission provide 
appropriate guidance as to mandatory sectors  and disclosures in the event that materiality continues to be 
a condition of disclosure.  
 
 We are aware of the campaign by certain agricultural organizations to oppose Scope 3 disclosure 
requirements.6  Rather than eliminating such disclosure requirements , we believe the Commission can 
reduce the concerns and costs associated with Scope 3 disclosures by making it clear that estimation, 
rather than field measurement, of such emissions is appropriate in sectors when measurement is not 
currently widely practiced. Using factors such as amount of agricultural land in a supply chain , and 
proxies for GHGs , such as type of cultivation practices and any measures deployed to sequester carbon or 
constrain carbon emissions , can yield useful information for the market without generating high costs 
associated with substantial field work to calculate agricultural Scope 3 emissions.  
 
Proportionality of transition plan and target requirements  
   In § 229.1506(a)(1), the rulemaking proposal would require a registrant to provide disclosures if it has 
set targets or goals related to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, or any other climate -related 
target or goal. In §229.1503(c)(1), the propos al requires that, “[i]f the registrant has adopted a transition 
plan as part of its climate -related risk management strategy, describe the plan, including the relevant 
metrics and targets used to identify and manage any physical and transition risks.”

 Investor engagements in the months since the closing of the comment period led us to conclude that 
the proposed requirements to disclose transition plans for achieving GHG reduction targets may be widely misunderstood as requiring a detailed articulation o f all steps necessary to accomplish even the longest -
term goals and targets.  It would be an unfortunate outcome of the r
ule if companies were to determine 
not to adopt Net Zero targets because they do not yet know how to achieve the longest -term targets.  
 
  Therefore, it might be helpful to provide guidance or examples in the preamble of the rule bringing 
clarity as to how      climate transition plans should be an articulation of transition -related business 
strategy across relevant time horizons for the compan y. A transitio n plan for Net Zero by 2050 goals 
would discuss how a company plans to move toward this goal, what short term and intermediate steps – 
such as adopting renewable energy or clean fleet vehicles -- are planned and what the company plans to 
do in the future to reduce emissions.  
 
 Just as in business strategy planning, we would expect a more rigorous evaluation by the Commission 
and investors on near- and medium -term implementation plans and that long -term goals and commitments 
would be proportionally less deta iled, as would normally be the case in any business planning.  
 
 This is consistent with the approach of the TCFD in discussing the impacts of short, medium and 
long- term climate related targets. The TCFD in its October 2021 publication “Guidance on Metrics,  
Targets and Transition Plans,” page 34, notes that the relative level of details expected on financial implications vary depending on the various time horizons of planning :

Pr
oposed Rule “ investor -optional”: 
1. It would make the design of the Proposed Rule  cons istent with the Commission’s core 
claim that there is investor demand for climate disclosure; if this is indeed the case, there 
is no reason to adopt a mandatory rule rather than an inv estor -optional rule; 
2. It would circumvent claims that the rule is invalid, which —to  the extent they apply at all—
apply only to a mandatory disclosure rule; and 
3. It would better protect investors than a mandatory rule, reducing costs  to in vestors , while 
preserving their benefits.  
As well as explaining why the Com mission  should let investors decide about climate disclosure, 
the Article explains how the Commission  should design investor-optional disclosure to ensure that 
it best protects investors. Letting investors decide would also have benefits beyond climate, not 
only for other “ESG” disclosure rules, but for the Commission ’s regulatory program more 
generally, and thus also for investors. 
I hope that the  sug gestions and analysis in the Article prove helpful to the Commission in its 
revision of the Proposed Rule. Should you have any questions about the analysis in the Article, 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Scott Hirst* 
28 S TAN. J.L.B US. & FIN. (forthcoming 2023) 
Designing a regulatory respons e to climate change is  one of the defining 
challenges of our era. In an attemp t to address it, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently proposed a historic rule 
requiring climate-related di sclosure by companies, resting squarely on the 
rationale of “investor demand.” The proposed climate  disclosure rule has 
met with an unprecedented response, some of it reflective of investor 
demand, but also including a broad array of opponents critical of the rule, 
who cast doubt on the rule’s validity. A judicial challenge is all but 
inevitable. 
This Article explains that the best  way for the SEC to save climate 
disclosure and to protect investors is to let them decide. That is, the SEC 
should let companies opt out of all or  part of their climate disclosure 
obligations if sufficient investors have voted to allow it to do so. This 
“investor-optional” approach would re sult in three important improvements 
necessary to save climate disclosure and best protect i nvestors. First, it 
would make the design of the SEC’s ru le consistent with the SEC’s core 
claim that there is investor demand for climate disclosure; if this is indeed 
the case, a mandatory rule is not necessary, creating a logical inconsistency 
that threatens the validity of a ma ndatory rule. Second, making climate 
disclosure investor-optional would ci rcumvent claims that the rule is 
invalid, which—to the extent they appl y at all—apply only to a mandatory 
disclosure rule. Third, an investo r-optional rule w ould better protect 
investors than a mandatory rule, reduci ng their net costs, while preserving 
their benefits. As a result, the SEC is required to consider an investor-optional rule, and having done so, it w ill be difficult for the SEC to justify 
adopting a mandatory rule instead. As well as explaining why the SEC 
should let investors decide about climate disclosure, the Article explains 
how the SEC should design the rule to ensure that it best protects investors. 
Letting investors decide would have be nefits beyond climate, not only for 
other “ESG” disclosure rules, but fo r the SEC’s regulatory program more 
generally, and thus also for investors.

 INTRODUCTION  
Designing a regulatory respons e to climate change is  one of the defining 
challenges of our era.1 In an attempt to address it, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently proposed a historic rule 
(hereinafter, the “Proposed Rule”).2 The rationale for the rule rests squarely 
on the claim made by the SEC that ther e is substantial “investor demand” 
for that disclosure.3 To meet this demand, for th e first time, all companies 
registered with the SEC would be requi red to disclose their climate risks 
and related information, both in thei r annual reports, and in registration 
statements. 
The required disclosure would incl ude the company’s direct greenhouse 
gas emissions (“Scope 1” emissions), their emissions from purchased 
energy (“Scope 2” emissions), and their indirect emissions from upstream 
and downstream activities (“Scope 3” emissions) if material, or if they have 
set a target for such emissions.4 They would also need to disclose the effects

how they identify, assess, and govern climate-related risks.  
The proposed climate disclosure rule has met with an unprecedented 
public response.5 Much of the response has re flected investor demand for a 
climate disclosure rule. But the Proposed  Rule has also been attacked by a 
broad array of opponents. These include one of the SEC’s own 
Commissioners, as well as members of Congress, state governors and 
attorneys general, industry groups, la wyers, academics, and many others.6 
These opponents question the level of  investor demand for climate 
disclosure, and argue that the Proposed Rule is likely to be invalid. A

challenge to the validity of the Propose d Rule in federal court seems all but 
inevitable.7 
The SEC, its supporters, and its opp onents, all presuppose that climate 
regulation should be struct ured as a uniform, mandato ry rule, that binds all 
registered companies to disclose all of the information stipulated in the 
Proposed Rule. Their debate has focused on comparing the Proposed Rule 
to the status quo, of no specific cl imate disclosure requirements. 
As this Article explains, this is a false duality. Largely ignored have 
been the many ways that a climate disc losure rule could be designed with 
some kind of optionality for companies or investors, allowing them to opt out of, or opt in to, disclosure requir ements. The lack of consideration of 
these alternative rule de signs is especially tro ubling, because—as this 
Article demonstrates—at least one such design is likely to be better for 
investors than the SEC’s mandatory Proposed Rule. 
This Article explains that the best  way for the SEC to save climate 
disclosure and to protect investors is to let them decide. That is, the SEC 
should let companies opt out of all or  part of their climate disclosure 
obligations if sufficient investor s have voted to allow it to do so.
8 Several 
important features of this design  would protect investors from the 
possibility that directors and office rs of the company would opt out of 
disclosure requirements against the inte rests of investors. Most importantly, 
the opt-out would have to have been approved by holders of a majority of the equity capital of the company that voted on the opt-out, and the vote 
would have to have taken place after the company had gone public.
9 In 
addition, structuring the optionality as  an opt-out from disclosure, rather 
than an opt-in to disclosure, would ma ke it most likely th at investor votes 
would be initiated where appropriate, because directors and managers—
those best able to initiate investor votes—would have incentives to do so 
whenever they believed investors woul d support an opt-out. This “investor-
optional” approach is therefore likely to be the best ap proach to climate 
disclosure that inco rporates optionality.

Proposal Likely to Face Legal Challenges , HARV. L. SCH. F. ON CORP. GOVERNANCE  (May

8 For a discussion of why the rule should be structured as an opt-out rule, rather than an 
opt-in rule, see infra Section I.B. 
9 For a discussion of the optimal design of the opt-out, see infra Part V. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  3 
 This Article compares these two rule  designs through the lens of three 
questions. First, which of the two designs  is more consistent with the SEC’s 
rationale for the rule? Second, which is more likely to survive appellate 
court review? And third, which is likely to be better for investors? These 
questions are closely intert wined: a climate disclosure rule is likely to be 
invalid if it is not consistent with the SEC’s given rati onale of investor 
demand, or if it is worse for invest ors than an altern ative designs. And 
increasing the likelihood of validity will result in greater benefits for investors. This Article strongly suggests  that an investo r-optional rule is 
likely to be better than a mandatory rule  in each of these three dimensions, 
corresponding to three clear and compelling reasons why the SEC should 
make the Proposed Rule  investor-optional. 
The first reason why the SEC should make the Proposed Rule investor-
optional is that it would make the design of the rule consistent with the 
SEC’s core justification for the rule —that there is investor demand for 
climate disclosure—and resolve the uncer tainty about the le vel of investor 
demand for climate disclosure.
10 This is important because the logical 
inconsistency between the SEC’s rationale and its choice of a mandatory design risks the Proposed Rule being adjudged arbitrary and capricious. In 
addition, opponents have raised uncertain ties regarding th e actual level of 
investor demand for climate disclosure, which are difficult to rebut for a mandatory rule, undermining the SE C’s basis for implementing the 
Proposed Rule.
11 Investor optionality would thus overcome these two major 
threats to the Proposed Rule. 
Investor demand is inconsistent with mandatory disclosure, but entirely 
consistent with an investor-optional rule. If there is indeed broad support for climate disclosure among investor s, there is no need for climate 
disclosure to be mandatory. If the SE C’s claims of broad investor demand 
were true, then investors would not allow the companies they invest in to 
opt out of an investor-optional rule. I ndeed, compared to the alternative of 
an investor-optional rule, a mandatory rule is only necessary if a majority 
of investors do not demand climate disclosure. 
Investor optionality would also address the underlying uncertainty 
regarding the level of in vestor demand for particul ar climate disclosures.
12 
 
10 See infra  Part II. 
11 See infra Section II.E. 
12 See infra Section II.B. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  4 
Opponents of the Proposed Rule have  argued that the SEC’s claims of 
investor demand are overstated—that companies already provide much of 
the information investors would de mand, that investors do not actually 
demand all of the information that th e Proposed Rule includes (especially 
given the costs of producing that info rmation), and that the views of the 
investors cited by the SEC in the Releas e are not representa tive of the views 
of a majority of investors.13 An investor-optional design would not only 
reconcile the competing claims of the SEC and its opponents, it is the only 
way to reconcile these claims, and th e only practical way to resolve the 
uncertainty regarding the level of investor demand.14 Investor optionality 
would condition disclosure on investor demand. If investors do not demand 
certain types of climate disclosure at a particular company, they will opt 
out, and companies will not be requi red to produce it. The disclosure 
obligations that remain  will be the ones inve stors actually demand.  
The second reason why the SEC should make the Proposed Rule 
investor-optional is that it would circ umvent the most important attacks on 
the Proposed Rule, which—to the extent they apply at a ll—apply only to a 
mandatory  disclosure rule. The Article a ddresses four arguments for the 
invalidity of the Proposed Rule raised  by its opponents; for each of these, 
investor optionality would act as a sh ield against invalidity. And if the SEC 
chooses to make its final rule mandator y, investor optionality could also act 
as sword against th e validity of that mandatory rule. 
One argument raised by opponents of  the Proposed Rule is that climate 
disclosure is  compelled speech , and therefore in violation of the First 
Amendment rights of companies.15 An investor-optional rule would 
circumvent this argument, because it would no longer compel speech. 
Instead, companies would be able to opt out of the disclosure obligation. Investor optionality would also answ er a novel variation on the compelled 
speech argument put forward by Sean Griffith, who suggests that mandatory climate disclosure would be subject to heightened scrutiny because it is 
“controversial.”
16 Investor-optional disclosu re would only be required 
where investors had not opted out of it . If they have not done so there would 
be a reasonable, probativ e—and uncontroversial—ba sis to conclude that 
they regard such disclosure as appropriate. 
 
13 See infra Section II.B. 
14 See infra Section II.D. 
15 See infra Section III.A 
16 See infra Section III.A. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  5 
 A second argument raised by opponents of the Proposed Rule is that 
climate disclosure is not material , because a reasonable investor would not 
consider it relevant to their investing decisions.17 Opponents of the 
Proposed Rule couple this with an a dditional claim that the SEC does not 
have the authority to require the disclo sure of matters that  are not material, 
and thus argue that climate disclosure falls outside the SEC’s authority. 
Investor optionality would circumvent this argument, because if climate 
disclosure were not material to investors in a particular company, they 
would allow it to opt out of that obligation. That investors do not opt out of 
particular climate disclosure obligat ions is thus reasonable and probative 
evidence that they consider  the information material. 
Two related arguments for invalidity make the claim that the SEC does 
not have statutory authority to require climate disclosure .18 One of these 
claims is based on the argument that cl imate disclosure is not part of the 
category of disclosure that the SEC is authorized to  require under the 
Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.19 However, 
the matters required to be disclosed u nder those statutes (and by subsequent 
amendments) can be understood as those matters that investors are likely to 
consider material in making investme nt or voting decisions. Under an 
investor-optional rule, th e only disclosure obligati ons that companies would 
be required to follow would be thos e that investors had not allowed the 
company to opt out of, and thus, that they are likely to find material for 
making investment or voti ng decisions. A related claim is that the Proposed 
Rule would implicate the recently-r ecognized “major questions” doctrine—
thereby requiring exp licit congressional authorization for climate 
disclosure—because it represents a br oad claim of authority by the SEC, 
departing from its past pr actice and regulatory norms.20 Allowing investors 
to opt out would circumvent this cl aim, by limiting the scope of the 
Proposed Rule, and by making it very clear that its purpos e is to protect 
investors, thereby substantially circ umventing the case that the major 
questions doctrine applies. 
A fourth type of argument for invalidity is that the SEC has not 
conducted appropriate or su fficient economic analysis  of the Proposed Rule 
 
17 See infra Section III.B. 
18 See infra Section III.C. 
19 Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77 a–77aa (2021); Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78a–78qq (2021). 
20 See infra Section III.C. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  6 
to show that the (uncertain) benefits  of disclosure outweigh its claimed 
costs.21 Making the Proposed Rule invest or-optional would make it much 
easier for the SEC to demonstrate that it had conducted appropriate 
economic analysis. Investor  optionality would cap the costs of the Proposed 
Rule to a particular company at the relatively small cost of opting out of 
disclosure obligations. The benefits of  climate disclosure would thus be 
much easier to justify compared to those opt-out costs, rather than in 
comparison to the much more substan tial costs of gathering and preparing 
climate disclosure information. And becau se of the possibility for investors 
to opt out of disclosure, the very struct ure of an investor- optional rule would 
make clear that any disclosure that co mpanies did not opt out of had greater 
benefit to investors than its costs. 
As well as being a shield against these attacks, investor optionality could 
also operate as a sword against a mandatory climate disclosure rule.22 The 
Administrative Procedure Act requires the SEC to consider reasonable alternatives to its proposed rules.
23 Investor optionality is a reasonable 
alternative to mandatory disclosure, as it is not only consistent with the SEC’s rationale for promulgating a clim ate disclosure rule, but it would be 
better for investors than mandatory disclosure. If the SEC does consider the 
investor-optional alternative to mandat ory disclosure, then it would need a 
good reason to nonetheless adopt a mandatory final rule. But the arguments made in this Article that investor op tionality would be be tter for investors 
will make it very challenging for the SEC to justify a mandatory rule. If it 
were to do so without adequate jus tification, its ru lemaking would be 
arbitrary and capricious, and therefor e subject to inva lidation under the 
Administrative Procedure Act.
24 
The third main reason why the SEC should make the Proposed Rule 
investor-optional is that it would be better for investors than a mandatory 
rule. The basic reasoning is straightforward. If all climate disclosure in the 
Proposed Rule has greater benefits for investors in all co mpanies than its 
costs, then no companies will opt out, and an investor-optional rule would be no worse than a mandatory rule. Bu t if any disclosure under the Proposed 
Rule had greater costs than benefits to investors in any company, investors 
 
21 See infra Section III.D. 
22 See infra  Section III.E. 
23 See infra notes 195-200 and accompanying text. 
24 See infra note 205 and accompanying text. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  7 
 in that company would opt out of such disclosure, making an investor-
optional rule less costly—a nd better for investors— than a mandatory rule. 
Of course, this reasoning is only correct if several important 
assumptions underlying it are also valid.25 These include the assumptions 
that investors are likely to vote for outcomes that are best for investors; that opt-outs will be initiated when they are likely to be beneficial for investors; 
that the costs to different investor s of opt-outs are likely to be roughly 
commensurate; and that the aggregate co sts of opt-out pro cesses are likely 
to be less than the overall benefits  from an investor-optional rule. The 
Article considers each of these the as sumptions, and demonstrates why they 
are reasonable, and why they unlikely to  be inaccurate in ways that would 
undermine the claim that investor opti onality would be better for investors 
than a mandatory rule.
26 
The most reasonable case for a mandator y rule to be better for investors 
than an investor-optional rule re volves around externality benefits.27 The 
base case for investor optionality bein g better for investors than a mandatory 
rule focuses on the costs and benefits to  investors in the disclosing company. 
However, a mandatory rule will be better for investors if the externality benefits from particular companies disclosing climate-related information 
to investors outside those companies ar e greater than the net costs of that 
disclosure to investors in the disc losing companies. Demonstrating the 
magnitude of these externality benefi ts to investors in other companies 
would be the best way for the SEC to justify the choice of a mandatory rule 
over an investor-optional rule. 
However, there are several reasons w hy externality benefits to investors 
in other companies are likely to be small.
28 Critically, the great majority of 
the investors in a company deciding whether to opt out are likely to 
internalize the cost of an opt-out de cision on investors in  other companies, 
because they are the same investors . Institutional investors in a company 
hold broadly diversified portfolios, so they are also the investors in many 
other companies. One group of outside investors in other companies whose 
views may not be fully inte rnalized are socially re sponsible investors that 
exclude environmentally-unfriendly companies from their portfolios. 
However socially responsible investor s currently make up less than 2% of 
 
25 See infra Section IV.B. 
26 See infra Section IV.B. 
27 See infra Section IV.C. 
28 See infra Section IV.C. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  8 
equity capital in U.S. companies. A nd even if investors in the company 
differ substantially fro m those outside the company, several market 
mechanisms are likely to cause the inve stors in the company to internalize 
many of the benefits of disclosure  to investors outside the company. 
An additional way in which investor optionality would be better for 
investors than a mandatory rule is  through the additional information it 
would provide.29 Opt-out decisions by companie s, or their absence, would 
provide a granular, automatic, observa ble, timely, and incontrovertible 
metric regarding the value and effectiveness of the Proposed Rule. This 
would not only assist other compan ies and investors with their own 
decisions regarding opt-outs, it would also allow the SEC to determine if 
parts of the Proposed Rule should be amended or repealed. However, the 
benefits to investors from an investo r-optional rule would not be dependent 
on such amendment (which might noneth eless involve considerable delay). 
Any disclosure requirements that inve stors believed were not appropriate 
would effectively be self-repealin g, because investors would permit 
companies to opt out of those requirements. 
Having explained why  the SEC should  let investors decide about climate 
disclosure, the Article explains how the SEC should design the rule to 
ensure that it best protects investors.30 Investor optionality is structured as 
an opt-out from disclosure , rather than an opt-in to disclosure, so that 
directors and managers—who have the gr eatest ability to initiate votes of 
investors—have incentives to initiate votes whenever investors are likely to approve them. Two additional features are necessary for investor-optional disclosure to be better for investors than a mandato ry rule: opting out must 
require approval, after a company has gone public; and it must be approved 
by shareholders holding a majority of th e equity capital of  the company. To 
create an optimal rule, opt-outs should also sunset after a certain period of 
time, such as five years,  giving investors an oppor tunity to change their 
minds regarding the opt-out. To avoi d potential entanglements with state 
law rules, rather than requiring a vote of investors with the specified 
characteristics, the SEC should allow companies to opt out if they have disclosed that the company has had a meeti ng that satisfies those criteria. 
And given the possibility that even an opt-out rule could be invalidated by 
 
29 See infra Section IV.D. 
30 See infra Part V. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  9 
 a hostile court, the SEC should hedge by also allowing companies to opt in 
to climate disclosure if their investors approved. 
The impact and implications of investor  optionality are substantial, both 
for climate disc losure and beyond.31 The Article offers some tentative 
predictions regarding th e likely impact of ma king the Proposed Rule 
investor optional, including which comp anies are likely to have investors 
that would favor opting out, and from which parts of the Proposed Rule.32 
Comment letters by the largest investor s suggest that they are unlikely to 
support opting out of the entirety of th e Proposed Rule, but that they might 
be willing to opt out of requirements that certain companies disclose Scope 
3 emissions and the effects of climat e change on line items in financial 
statements. Given that these investors hold substantial stakes in the great 
majority of large companies, it is on ly at microcap companies—where these 
investors are less likely to hold substantial stakes—t hat opt-outs from 
disclosure in general may plausibly occur. Investors in these companies 
might be influenced against opting out by the possibility of signaling 
effects. And even if they did opt out, these companies represent a very small 
fraction of the U.S. capital markets. 
The clearest implication of this Articl e is that the SEC should not simply 
assume that rules govern ing corporations should be mandatory, but should 
instead consider alternative rule designs, such as investor optionality. Beyond climate disclosure, investor op tionality would be most obviously 
beneficial for other “ESG ” rules that the SEC may be considering, for which 
the same rationale will apply.
33  In other work, I have explained how this 
principle potentially applies to all SEC rules regulating companies for the 
protection of investors.34 The Article develops some boundary conditions 
for determining which other SEC rule s are most likely to benefit from 
investor optionality. The most benefi t would be for new rules where there 
is considerable uncertainty regarding the likely benefit of the rule for

investors, or where those benefits ar e likely to vary across companies or 
investors. For established rules where there is likely to be little investor 
support for opting out, there would be little benefit from making the rule 
investor-optional. These boundary conditions assuage potential concerns that investor optionality could be a “s lippery-slope:” in most cases, it is 
instead likely to be a “sticky slope.” 
One additional benefit of letting in vestors decide would be for SEC 
rulemaking. Not only would investor optionality redu ce the risk of 
invalidation of their rules, it w ould reduce the cost of rulemaking, by 
making it easier to cond uct the economic analysis necessary to support its 
rulemaking. This would be beneficial no matter the view one takes 
regarding SEC rulemaking—it would eith er reduce the cost of making the 
same number of SEC rules, or allow the SEC to make more rules for the same cost. It would also facilitate ex perimentation with potential policies, 
and the quality of information that such experimentation would provide. These improvements to SEC rulema king would redound to investors, 
through better regulation.  
The Article is structured as follows.  Part I describes the SEC’s Proposed 
Rule, and the important questions about its design that it leaves unanswered. 
Part II explains how taki ng investor demand serious ly requires the SEC to 
adopt an investor-optional rule, to avoid the inconsistency between the 
investor demand rationale and mandato ry disclosure, and to resolve the 
uncertainty regarding investor dema nd. Part III explains how making the 
Proposed Rule investor-optional would circumvent the major claims that 
the Proposed Rule is invalid, and also  how choosing a ma ndatory rule over 
an investor-optional design could be  grounds for invalidity. Part IV 
demonstrates why an inve stor-optional rule would be better for investors 
than a mandatory disclosure rule. Part V explains how the SEC should design investor optionality to best prot ect investors. Part VI considers the 
impact and implications of investor op tionality, both for climate disclosure 
and beyond. 
I. SEC
 CLIMATE DISCLOSURE & ITS DESIGN  
The key message of this Article is that the SEC can and should save its 
proposed climate disclosure rule, by improving the design of the rule. 
Section I.A introduces the Proposed Rule, including the regulatory background to the rule, the content of the rule, and the response it has November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  11 
 received. Section I.B turns to the important question of the design of the 
Proposed Rule—whether it should be mandatory or permit some 
optionality, and if the latter, how su ch optionality should be structured. 
A. The SEC’s Climate Disclosure Rule 
The stakes for the validity of the SEC’s Proposed Rule could not be 
higher. Designing a regulatory response to climate change is one of the 
defining challenges of our time, and a “wicked problem par excellence.”35 
Limiting the effects of climate ch ange is an obvious public good, which 
cannot be overcome by private ac tion alone and requires regulatory 
intervention.36 But even though the fact of  climate change is beyond 
reasonable doubt, there is a substantial disagreement ov er regulatory 
solutions. The challenge of passing comprehensive legislation to address 
climate change has made agencies like the SEC a major focus of attempts 
to develop and implement regulatory solutions.37 
The current regulatory landscape for cl imate disclosure by companies is 
sparse.38 Since 1982, companies have been re quired to disclo se information 
relating to litigation and business costs arising from compliance with laws protecting the environment.
39 Climate-related issues that are financially 
material to the company are required to be disclosed in the same way as any

other financially material matters.40 However, existing rules do not impose 
specific legal obligations to disclose climate-related risks.41 Instead, many 
companies voluntarily disclose some information regardi ng their emissions 
and climate-related risks, often in re sponse to pressure from their investors 
or consumers.42

approved, the Proposed Rule would add new parts to the SEC’s regulations 
that are applicable to public companies registered with the SEC.44 
Companies would be require d to file climate-related information as part of 
annual reports and registration statemen ts, and in the fina ncial statements 
that are included in those documents.45 The content of the required 
disclosure would cons ist of the following:

the registrant’s board and management; 
2. How any climate-related risks identified by the registrant 
have had or are likely to have a material impact on its

The SEC’s authority and rationale fo r the Proposed Rule are central to 
the question of the Proposed Rule’s validity.47 The SEC put forward the 
Proposed Rule based on its authority  under the Securities Act of 1933, and 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to promulgate di sclosure rule s that are 
“necessary or appropriate in the public  interest or for the protection of

reporting companies, and their disclosure by other companies would be subject to a safe

investors.”48 Both statutes also require the SEC to take into account whether 
the rules “will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation.”49 
In the Release, the SEC justifies imposing the requirement to disclose 
climate-related information because that  information “may be material to 
investors in making investment or voting decisions,”50 and thus “many 
investors—including share holders, investment advi sers, and investment 
management companies” currently demand the information.51 Despite this 
demand, the SEC explains that “existing disclosures of clim ate-related risks 
do not adequately protect investors, ” because they are insufficient or 
incomplete, because they are not consis tent or comparable with those of 
other companies, and because they are not subject to a full range of liability 
and other regulatory provisions.52 Part II discusses the implications of this 
“investor demand” rationale for the design of the Proposed Rule.

lesser extent, on the information that should be included if it does.63

disclosure rule that the SEC w ould impose—whether the rule should 
mandate disclosure for all companies, or whether it s hould involve some

59 For a detailed analysis of comment letters responding to the Proposed Rule, see Hupart 
et al., supra note 53. 
60 The great majority of comment letters (84%) were submitted using form letters 
provided by various organizations, of which a strong majority (88%) supported the Proposed Rule. Id. 
61 Hupart et al. estimate that 32% of letter opposing the Proposed Rule claim that the 
Proposed Rule is outside the SEC’s authority, and 21% argue that the Proposed Rule will impose extensive and unreason able costs on companies. See id.  
62 See, e.g. , Vallette & Gray, supra  note 7. 
63 For contributions to the debate focusing on whether the SEC should regulate climate 
change disclosure, see, e.g., Fisch & Williams, supra  note 54 (arguing in favor of SEC 
regulation of climate change di sclosure); Cunningham et al., supra  note 54 (arguing against 
SEC regulation of climate change disclosure). Fo r an analysis of the content of SEC climate 
change disclosure, see, e.g., Madison Condon, Sarah Ladin, Jack Lienke, Michael Panfil 
& Alexander Song, Mandating Disclosure of Climate-Related Financial Risk , 23 N.Y.U.  
J. LEGIS. & PUB. POL’Y 745 (2022). November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  17 
 type of optionality, allowing companies or investors to opt out of the rule, 
or opt in to the rule.64 
The SEC’s Proposed Rule presupposes , without additi onal examination 
or justification, that the SEC’s climate disclosure ru le should be uniformly 
mandatory—that all companies to which it applies would be required to 
disclose the information sti pulated in the Proposed Rule.65 Advocates for 
climate disclosure generally make  a similar assump tion, comparing a 
mandatory rule to the status quo.66 Opponents of the Propos ed Rule also do 
not suggest an altern ative, but prefer that the st atus quo be maintained, with 
no climate disclosure regulation.67 
But simply comparing the mandatory Proposed Rule to the status quo 
implies a false duality. It  ignores the mul tiplicity of ways that a climate 
disclosure rule could be designed with some kind of optionality for companies and investors, such as al lowing companies or investors to opt 
out of climate disclosure , or to opt in to it.
68 Each of these a lternatives differ 
from both the status quo and the Proposed Rule in important respects, 
including the level of disclosure that is likely to result, and the costs and benefit to investors from that disclosu re. The lack of consideration by the 
SEC or its opponents of alternative rule designs is troubling because, as this Article demonstrates, at least one kind of optionality is likely to be better 
for investors than the SEC’s mandatory Proposed Rule. The focus of this 
 
64 Opt-in and opt-out rules are both types of “private ordering.” That category would also 
include the status quo of no regulation, whereby companies can decide whether to 
voluntarily disclose climate-related information. 
65 The Proposed Rule would “accommodate” certa in categories of companies, especially 
smaller companies, by exempting them from certa in disclosure requirements. In particular, 
small reporting companies (SRCs) would not need to disclose Scope 3 emissions, and 
attestation requirements would apply only to accel erated filers and large accelerated filers. 
The requirements would also be phased in, becoming applicable to large accelerated filers 
first (in 2024), and SRCs last (in 2026). See Proposed Rule, supra note 2, 21345-46.  
66 See, e.g. , Condon, supra  note 54, at 69–70 (discussing the SEC’s work preparing 
“proposed rules for mandatory climate risk disclosure.”); Condon, Ladin, Lienke, Panfil & Song, supra note 63, at 749 (indicating that the artic le “details the need for new, mandatory 
disclosure requirements and makes recommendations for crafting them”). 
67 For example, the comment letter authored by Larry Cunningham and 21 other law and 
finance professors argues against the Proposed  Rule, but does not suggest an alternative 
formulation. See Cunningham et al., supra note 54. 
68 An important precursor to this Article is the discussion of optionality in agency 
rulemaking (and SEC rulemaking in particular) by Alex Lee, one version of which (described by Professor Lee as a “menu-of-options” approach) is very similar to that which 
I refer to here as “investor optionality.” See generally Yoon-Ho Alex Lee, An Options 
Approach to Agency Rulemaking , 65 A
DMIN . L. REV. 881 (2013). November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  18 
Article is on comparing th e Proposed Rule to one such  kind of op tional rule, 
which I refer to as “investor optional ity,” whereby companies could opt out 
of climate disclosure if investors approve.69 The remainder of this Section 
explains why this Article focuses on that comparison, rather than comparing 
the Proposed Rule to another of the many possible rule designs. 
The question of whether the Proposed  Rule would be better than the 
status quo of no climate regulation has been extensively and amply 
analyzed.70 Views have been expressed by the SEC itself,71 as well as by 
many of those submitting detailed comments to the SEC in response to the 
Proposed Rule.72 This Article does not presume to add to that discussion. 
Instead, the Article takes as a given that there should be some  form of SEC 
regulation of climate disclosure, and analyzes how  that climate disclosure 
should be designed.73 
This Article focuses on the investor-optional alternative, rather than 
other possible optional rules, because it includes important guardrails that 
are important to protect investors.74 The most importa nt constraints on 
optionality in the design proposed here are that the option should be to opt out of disclosure, rather than to opt  in, and that the opt out should be 
approved by investors. Together, these features mean that investor optionality has the greatest likelihood of benefiting investors more than a 
mandatory rule. The remainder of this Article substantiates this claim, and 
 
69 Investor optionality, as the term is used in this Article, would also involve the 
additional features described in infra Part V. 
70 For an extensive discussion of the need for climate disclosure, see generally Condon, 
supra  note 54. For discussions of mandatory sustainability disclosure, see Christensen, Hail 
& Leuz, supra  note 42; Condon, Ladin, Lienke, Panfil, & Song, supra  note 63. 
71 See, e.g. , Proposed Rule, supra note 2, at 21413 (describing the “Baseline . . .” for the 
SEC’s economic analysis, cons isting of “the current regulatory and economic landscape 
with respect to climate-related disclosures.”).  
72 See supra notes 54-59. 
73 Because of my pres upposition that some form of SEC regulation is appropriate, I 
generally avoid the use of the term “private or dering.” Private ordering generally refers to 
the involvement of private actors (in this ca se, companies or investors) in regulation. See 
Steven L. Schwarcz, Private Ordering , 97 N W. U. L. REV. 319, 319 (2002)  (referring to 
private ordering as “[t]he sharing of regulato ry authority with private actors”). This would 
include the status quo of no regulation, where company managers choose whether to 
disclose climate-related information. The discussion of “no regulation” private ordering 
has overshadowed other kinds of private ordering, obscuring the possibility and importance 
of optionality within an SEC rule, both with respect to the Proposed Rule, and in other regulatory instances. See, e.g. , Lucian A. Bebchuk & Scott Hirst, Private Ordering and the 
Proxy Access Debate, 65 B
US. LAW. 329 (2010).  
74 For a discussion of those guardrails, see infra Part V. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  19 
 considers the importance of  the individual features.75 But before moving on, 
I first briefly explain the reasoning w hy investor optionality is likely to 
better for investors than other designs, such as an opt-out rule without 
investor approval, and opt-in rule, or the status quo of no regulation. 
The comparison of mandatory rules and private ordering has a storied 
history, including in corporate law,76 and with respect to securities 
regulation.77 The key insights motivating the reasoning in this Article can 
be traced to foundational work by Ian Ay res and Robert Gertner explaining 
that in many cases it would be optimal to  design rules as “p enalty defaults,” 
that the parties would not want, so that  at least one of the private parties 
involved would have an incentive to opt out.78 Lucian Bebchuk and Assaf 
Hamdani applied this insight to state co rporate law rules, explaining that for 
corporate law rules, efficient rules would be those where corporate 
managers have an incentive to opt out.79 This follows from the fact that 
managers control the mach inery and resources of the corporation, so it is 
much easier and less costly for them  to initiate an opt-out decision.80 In 
contrast, investors bear their own costs, and face a classic collective action 
 
75 See generally  infra Parts II-IV (substantiating the claim that an investor-optional rule 
is likely to be better than a mandatory rule); infra Part V (discussing how investor 
optionality should be designed). See also infra notes 89-97 and accompanying text 
(discussing why an opt-out structure is likely to be better than an opt-in structure).  
76 Mostly notably, this was a central question in the debate regarding the appropriate role 
of mandatory rules versus “contractual freedom ” in corporate law. For an early argument 
in favor of private ordering, see Frank H. Easterbrook & Daniel R. Fischel, The Corporate 
Contract , 89 C OLUM . L. REV. 1416 (1989). A number of important contributions to this 
debate were also part of the same 1989 symposium; for a summary, see generally Lucian 
Arye Bebchuk, The Debate on Contractual Freedom in Corporate Law , 89 C OLUM . L. 
REV. 1395 (1989). 
77 For key contributions to this debate advocating for the ability of corporations to choose 
alternative disclosure regimes, see generally Roberta Romano, Empowering Investors: A 
Market Approach to Securities Regulation , 107 Y ALE L.J. 2359 (1998) ; Merritt B. Fox, 
Retaining Mandatory Securities Disclosure : Why Issuer Choice Is Not Investor 
Empowerment , 85 V A. L. REV. 1335 (1999) (defending the importance of mandatory 
disclosure rules). For a summary of this debate, see generally Merritt B. Fox, The Issuer 
Choice Debate , 2 T HEORETICAL INQUIRIES L. 563 (2001).

79 See generally Lucian Arye Bebchuk & Assaf Hamdani, Optimal Defaults for 
Corporate Law Evolution , 96 N W. U. L. REV. 489 (2002). 
80 This is also the basis for the assumption that opt-out decisions will generally be 
initiated when it is optimal to do so, as desc ribed in Section IV.B.2. For the reasons outlined 
here, the same assumption would be much less likely to apply for an opt-in rule. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  20 
problem.81 Of course, to protect investor s where their incentives did not 
align with those of managers, investors would have to approve such opt-
outs.82 
This line of reasoning leads to the conclusion that many SEC rules 
regulating corporations coul d also be optimally designed be more restrictive 
of managers, but to allow the corporation to opt out if shareholders approved.
83 This Article applies that particular insight to the issue of SEC 
climate disclosure.84 My earlier work explains the conditions for the insight 
to hold for SEC rules more generally.85 Approval by investors was not 
reasonable when the securities rules we re initially implemented, because of 
the dispersion of shareholders, and therefore their limited likelihood of 
investing time and effort in making voting decisions, such as whether to opt out.
86 But large, sophisticated instituti onal investors are now prevalent in 
contemporary corporate ownership. They have the resources and the incentives to make informed decisions about the companies they invest in. 
As a result, investor approval of opt-out decisions is now both possible and reasonable.
87 
This reasoning explains why an invest or-optional rule would be better 
than an optional rule that  did not require investor  approval, or an opt-in 
rule.88 It therefore also explains why an  investor-optional rule would be

82 For applications of the investor approval requirement see generally Bebchuk & 
Hamdani, supra  note 79 (considering corporate law rules); Hirst, supra  note 34 
(considering SEC rules). 
83 See generally Hirst, supra  note 34. This conclusion can al so be seen as an instantiation 
of a proposal made by Alex Lee, whereby agency rules would allow “contingent ex post 
exemptions.” See Lee, supra  note 68, at 923–32. In this case, the contingency would be the 
approval of an opt-out by investors. Indeed, as an example, Professor Lee discusses the 
SEC’s own consideration of an opt-out vote from the SEC’s proxy access rule. See id. at 
928. For a further discussion of opting-out in the context of the SEC’s proxy access rule, 
see infra  notes 90-98 and accompanying text. 
84 Disclosure, including climate disclosure, is a harder case for the application of 
investor-ordering than rules which do not involve disclosure, such as rules relating to company governance, as they are much less likely to involve positive externalities for other 
investors, and thus the main potential counter-argument examined in Section IV.C is unlikely to apply.  
85 See generally Hirst, supra  note 34. 
86 See id.  at 270–71. 
87 See id.  at 260–61. 
88 Although an opt-in rule would not be as good for investors as an opt-out rule, it is 
likely to be better than no rule at all, as discussed further in Section V.F. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  21 
 better than the status  quo of no company climate disclosure regulation: with 
no substantive regulation, companies will only disclose where their 
managers so choose, which is unlikely to be suffici ent to protect investors.89 
The superiority of an opt-out rule  over an opt-in rule, or over no 
regulation, can be seen from the resu lts of the SEC’s failed 2010 “proxy 
access” rule.90 That rule required companies to allow shareholders to 
include nominees in a company’s proxy statement, if they  had held 3% of 
the company’s shares for more than three years, and satisfied certain procedural requirements.
91 Despite considering both an opt-in and an opt-
out version of the rule, the SEC chose a mandatory rule design.92 The SEC’s 
mandatory rule was invalidated by the U. S. Court of Appeals for the District 
of Columbia Circuit.93 After the decision, the absence of a rule left 
companies free to “opt-in” to proxy access by amending their bylaws. But 
relatively few managers voluntarily adopted such arrangements, and 
generally did so only after sustained pre ssure from investors,  in the form of 
shareholder proposals requesting such changes.94 Those that did generally 
 
89 One way of answering the question whether that an investor-optional rule is better for 
investors than the status quo is transitively, i. e., if the Proposed Rule is better for investors 
than the status quo, and an investor-optional rule is better than a mandatory rule, then an 
investor-optional rule will also be better for investors than the status quo. A more substantive explanation follows similar analysis to that set out in Section IV.A comparing 
investor-optional disclosure to the Proposed Rule: Companies for which all or part of the 
investor-optional rule is no better than the status quo will opt out of those parts, and will be very slightly worse off than under the status  quo, to the extent of the cost of opting out. 
Companies for which parts of the investor-optional rule is better than the status quo will not opt out and will accrue those benefits. An investor-optional rule will therefore be better for investors if the benefit from the rule to investors in any company that does not opt out 
entirely is greater than the sum for all companies that do opt out, of the costs of the opt out 
process. As discussed in Section IV.B.4, the opt out costs for each company are likely to be very small, and to the extent there is in vestor demand for climate disclosure, there are 
likely to be substantial benefits to investors in many companies from not opting out of a climate disclosure rule.

took the parameters in the SEC’s invalid ated rule as a template for such 
arrangements.95 But the result was limited and uneven uptake of proxy 
access among companies, despite stro ng investor support for proxy access, 
and an extensive campaign by investors lasting many years.96 This result is 
wholly unsurprising. Collective ac tion problems and agency problems 
among investors mean that there is likely to be under-initiation of such 
proposals.97 Had the rule been structured as an opt-out rule, all of the 
companies where investors suppor ted proxy access would been bound by 
the structure immediately, without n eeding to rely on the delayed and 
piecemeal efforts investors with limited resources to initiate opt-ins.98  
II. TAKING INVESTOR DEMAND SERIOUSLY  
The SEC has placed investor demand for climate disclosure at the center 
of its rationale for climate disclosure regulation.99 As I explain in this Part, 
this has important implications for the de sign of the rule. If  it takes investor 
demand seriously, the SEC should not make its climate disclosure rule mandatory, since that woul d be inconsistent with broad investor demand. 
Instead, it should make it investor-optional.
100 Not only would an investor-
optional rule be entirely consistent w ith broad investor demand for climate 
disclosure, it would also reconcile the competing claims of the SEC and its opponents regarding the uncertain leve l of investor demand. Should the 
SEC nevertheless proceed with a mandatory disclosure rule, the inconsistency between that  rule design and the br oad investor demand on 
which the SEC has predicated the need  for the Proposed Rule provides a

 potential ground for the Proposed Rule to  be invalidated as arbitrary and 
capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act.101 
The investor demand rati onale is the central part  of the SEC’s argument 
that it has authority to require climat e disclosure for inve stor protection. But 
before moving on to consider the i nvestor demand rationale, it is worth 
considering a basis for authority, and related rationa le, that the SEC chose 
not to follow: the public interest. Both the Securities Act and the Securities 
Exchange Act give the SEC the power to make rules that are “necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest or  for the protection of investors.”102 The 
SEC could have chosen to base the need for climate disclosure on the 
“public interest.”103 Doing so could allow an end run around the points made 
in this Article, that investor optiona lity would be better for investors. 
Reasonable arguments could be made  about how consumers or citizens 
would benefit from climate disclosure , given the important  part it might 
play in reducing greenhouse gas emi ssions, and limiting global warming.104 
These externality benefits would likely be much more significant than the externality benefits (if any) to invest ors in other companies (discussed in 
Section IV.C), and potentially sufficient to justify requiring disclosure by all companies without the possibility of opting out. However, the SEC does 
not discuss the “public interest” in cl imate disclosure, other than to the 
extent that it is furthe red by protecting investors.
105 It is likely that

(recognizing this as he basis of the SEC’s authority for the rule). 
103 Indeed, Commissioner Allison Herren Le e had previously pointed out the SEC’s 
public interest authority in remarks discussing climate regulation. See Comm’r Allison

Commissioner Hester Peirce pointed out, the Pr oposed Rule has the appearance of a rule 
intended for the public interest. See generally Comm’r Hester M. Peirce, SEC, W E ARE

2022), https://www.sec.gov/new s/statement/peirce-climate-di sclosure-20220321 (arguing 
that the Proposed Rule aims “to achieve ob jectives that are not  ours to pursue”). 
104 In addition, this rationale would better reflect the political reality of support for 
climate from those who wish to impose climate disclosure rules not only to help investors, 
but as part of an attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which they believe would 
benefit society as a whole. 
105 For the six places the SEC references public  interest in the Release—all in connection 
with protection of investors—see Proposed Rule, supra note 2, at 21335, 21337, 21340, 
21412. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  24 
grounding its authority on investor protection (and not general public 
interest) was a reasonable strategic decision, aimed at avoiding grounds for 
the possible invalidation of the Proposed Rule.106 But the effect of this 
decision is to prevent the SEC from justifying the Proposed Rule on the 
basis of the Proposed Rule’s benefits for any constituencies other investors. 
Section II.A describes the SEC’s i nvestor demand rationale and the 
premises regarding which investors demand climate disclosure, and for 
what. Section III.B examines the ques tions and counter-arguments that 
opponents of the Proposed Rule have rais ed regarding the investor demand 
rationale. Sections II.C and II.D expl ain, respectively, how the investor 
demand rationale is inconsistent w ith a mandatory ru le, and how an 
investor-optional rule is not only c onsistent with the investor-demand 
rationale, but would reconcile the competing claims of the SEC and its 
opponents. Section II.E explains the ri sks for the SEC of not taking the 
investor demand ra tionale seriously. 
A. The Investor Demand Rationale and Its Premises 
The SEC’s central rationale for promulgating the Proposed Rule is the 
“growing investor demand for climate-rel ated risk disclosure and related 
information.”107 Indeed, the Release is replete with references to “investor 
demand” for that information, with more than forty such mentions.108 
 
106 For instance, critics of the SEC’s Proposed Rule have pointed to the Supreme Court’s 
view, interpreting similar “public interest” language authorizing rulemaking by the Federal 
Power Commission, that “[t]his Court’s cases have consistently held that the use of the words “public interest” in a re gulatory statute is not a broad license to promote the general 
public welfare. Rather, the words take meaning from the purposes of the regulatory legislation.” See Bernard Sharfman & James Copland, Comment Letter on Proposed Rule 
for The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors 4 
(June 16, 2022) (quoting from NAACP v. FPC, 425 U.S. 662, 669 (1976)), 
https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-10 -22/s71022-20131661-302049.pdf. 
It is also possible that regulating corporate climate disclosure for the “public benefit” 
could be seen as a major transformation in the SEC’s regulation (which is currently focused on investor protection), and thus a “major question” that is subject to the “major questions 
doctrine,” discussed further in Section III.C. 
107 Proposed Rule, supra note 2, at 21340–43 (describing “The Growing Investor 
Demand for Climate-Related Risk Disclosure and Related Information”). 
108 This includes all references to cognates of “demand,” where the sentence makes clear 
that the “demand” is from investors. See id. at 21334–35, 21337–38, 21340–41, 21355, 
21362–63, 21377, 21381, 21394, 21424–25, 2 1434, 21436, 21441, 21443, 21462, 21468 . 
See also Cunningham et al., supra  note 54, at 3 (suggesting that the Release “refers to 
“investor demand” 54 times). November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  25 
 The investors that the SEC refers to are generally large investment 
managers, public pension funds, and socially responsible investment 
managers. For instance, th e Release refers prominently to the “733 global 
institutional investors” that were signatories to th e Global Investor 
Statement to Governments on Climate Change.109 Particular investors 
mentioned in the Release include BlackRock (mentioned eleven times), the 
New York State Comptroller (fourt een times), and Trillium Socially 
Responsible Investing (nine times).110 
Despite its reliance on “investor dema nd” to justify the Proposed Rule, 
the SEC does not closely ex amine the nature or detail of the claimed demand 
in the Release. Key aspects of investor  demand are discusse d only in general 
terms in the Release, or not at all,  including which pa rticular investors 
demand climate disclosure (with little attention to those that do not); what 
information those investors demand; and from which companies.111 The 
generality of these claims makes it hard to evaluate or falsify the SEC’s 
arguments about investor demand, a nd especially, to understand whether 
investor demand is likely to differ  among different investors, or for 
disclosure from different companies.112 Nevertheless, the way in which the 
SEC makes its claims, and the evidence it uses to support them, allows an inference to be drawn about its li kely views on who demands climate 
information. 
The SEC’s support for the investor demand claim focused squarely on 
institutional investors.
113 The main part of the SEC’s evidence for the 
“growing investor demand for climate-rel ated risk disclosure and related 
information” is a series of major cl imate-related initiatives by groups of 
 
109 Proposed Rule, supra note 2, at 21340. 
110 These citation counts are drawn from the an alysis of the Release’s citation patterns in 
Cunningham et al., supra  note 54, at 20. 
111 The SEC’s most granular claims involve listing particular investor groups that 
“criticized the current disclosure practice … because it has not produced consistent, 
comparable, reliable information for investors and their advisors, who otherwise have 
difficulty obtaining that information,” and listing climate initiatives among investors that have pushed for more information. See Proposed Rule, supra note 2, at 21339-41. 
112 The SEC could have attempted to generate this information by conducting a 
comprehensive survey of investors, but there is no mention in the Release of any attempt to do so. 
113 The discussion in this Article is focused on equity investors, rather than creditors. 
This is consistent with the arguments presen ted in this Article, as only equity investors 
generally have voting rights. But it raises the question whether debt investors should have 
voting rights. This applies not just to opt-out decisions, but is a broader question of corporate law, and beyond the scope of this Article. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  26 
institutional investors.114 The SEC refers to a large majority of institutional 
investors surveyed in 2021 consider ing climate change their highest 
engagement priority.115 The SEC also references climate change being the 
top priority for engagement by two la rge investment managers, BlackRock 
and State Street Global Advisors (SSGA).116 Even when the SEC implicitly 
refers to demand from retail investors it is considering them  as investors in 
mutual funds.117 With the exception of those investors, and several more 
whose comments are referred to in footnotes, the SEC does not specify 
which investors demand climate disclosu re, or the proportion of the equity 
capital of U.S. companies that they re present. Nevertheless, its claim seems 
to be that there is broad and grow ing support from institutional investors.118 
The SEC’s focus on institutional invest ors as providing the basis for the 
investor demand rationale has important implications for the arguments 
regarding the design of the climate disclosure rule, which I return to 
below.119 
B. The Uncertainty About Investor Demand 
A major potential issue with foundi ng the authority for the Proposed 
Rule on investor demand is there the SEC’s analysis leaves significant uncertainty regarding the level of inve stor demand for climate change, and 
what exact disclosure a majority of investors would require from particular companies. Indeed, critics of the Pr oposed Rule have raised significant 
questions that bear on the SE C’s investor demand rationale.
120 They have 
argued that companies already disclose  climate-related information to the 
extent that investors require it, and therefore, there is no unmet investor 
 
114 The SEC lists the Global Investor Statement to Governments on the Climate Crisis, 
the UN Principles for Responsible Investment , the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, the 
Climate Action 100+, and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. See Proposed Rule, 
supra note 2, at 21340–41. See also  id. at 21425 (listing the Climate Disclosure Project,

Climate Change, and the Transition Pathway Initiative).

120 For many of these comments, see supra notes 54-58 and accompanying text. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  27 
 demand for additional disclosure.121 They argue that the SEC’s claims of 
investor demand are overstated, beca use the demand from investors cited 
by the SEC comes from an outspoken mi nority of institutional investors, 
and that a majority of investors do  not demand additional disclosure.122 
They also argue that investor demand is not identical across companies or 
for different types of disclosure: for so me companies, some kinds of climate 
disclosure is not as important to the investors in those companies, and may 
not be sufficiently valuable to justify the cost of producing it.123 Critics 
further claim that even if a major ity of investment managers do demand 
some climate disclosure, the views of  those managers do not necessarily 
reflect those of their benefi cial investors, which (they claim) are the relevant 
group of investors that should be considered.124 
The SEC’s Release does not provide su fficient evidence to rebut these 
claims, or to resolve their inconsiste ncy with the SEC’s investor demand 
rationale. As critics point out, many of the institutional i nvestors mentioned 
in the Release, and many of those inve stors involved in the major initiatives 
the Release relies on, are non-U.S. inve stors, and so much of the large 
amounts of capital mentioned by the SEC as supporting disclo sure are likely 
to be invested outside the U.S. capital markets.125 This is not to say that the 
claims of critics are accurate, just that the SEC does not provide a means of 
reconciling the competing claims, leaving real uncertainty about the actual 
level and details of investor demand. 
C. Investor Demand and Mandatory Disclosure 
A major problem with the SEC’s reliance on investor demand as the 
rationale for its Proposed Rule  is that it is inconsiste nt with the SEC’s choice 
 
121 See, e.g. , Cunningham et al., supra  note 54, at 8–11 (describ ing the “ample supply of 
climate disclosure). 
122 See, e.g., id.  at 3–5 (discussing “subgroup[s] of investors the [Proposed Rule] unjustly 
favors”). 
123 See, e.g. , Nat’l Ass’n of Mfrs., supra note 55, at 24 (arguing for more lenient treatment 
of small, newly public, mid-size, and recently acquired issuers); id. at 32  (arguing against 
a one-size-fits-all threshold for disclosure). 
124 See, e.g. , Cunningham et al., supra note 54, at 5–7 (discussing that the views of 
individual investors are not canvassed in the Proposed Rule, and suggesting that the SEC 
“ask institutions “demanding” [climate disclosure] whether they have polled their 
individual clients, the ultimate investors, to determine whether they agree on the 
desirability or need for such information.”).  
125 See, e.g. , id. at 3 (“The Proposal does not . . . indicate the portion of the reported assets 
invested in SEC registrants as compared to other investments around the world,” and giving examples of non-U.S. investors among the seven most relied-upon in the Proposed Rule). November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  28 
of a mandatory rule design—it does not  justify the choice of a mandatory 
disclosure rule over an investor-optional rule. As  I explain below, this 
provides grounds for the potential invalidation of the rule. 
The reason is straightforward. If there is broad support from institutional 
investors for climate disclosure, then there is no need for a mandatory rule. 
An investor-rule would be sufficient,  because the majority of investors 
supporting disclosure would prevent the company from opting out of the 
requirement.126 
In order to justify the ch oice of a mandatory rule rather than an investor-
optional rule, the SEC would have to  argue that there are sufficient 
companies where a majority of investors would be willing to  opt out of some 
or all of the climate disclosure re quirements. If that is the case, it could (but 
would not necessarily) justify a mandato ry rule to protect a minority of 
investors in a company that do dema nd climate disclosure, or investors 
outside the company that would prefer  that the company discloses climate-
related information. Thes e involved difficult and nuanced balancing 
questions, which I analyze in detail in Section IV.C. Here I merely point out that the SEC has not made these argu ments in supporting the Proposed Rule. 
To do so would require considerable analysis of the specifics of investor demand—which investors support climate disclosure of wh at matters, and 
at how many companies. The broad generalities of the SEC’s claims of investor demand provide no such specifics. 
It is important to note that the SEC’s claim of investor demand does 
justify the imposition of some SEC rule, compared to the status quo of no 
climate disclosure regulation. The mere existence of an SEC rule on climate 
disclosure provides at least three valuab le features that benefit corporations 
and investors, irrespective of whether or  not the rule is ma ndatory. First, an 
SEC rule provides a reasoned and thoughtful choice of standard  for 
corporate arrangements, which serves as a focal point for centralization and 
standardization of arrangements acr oss corporations, and thus, network 
externality benefits to all that adopt the arrangement.
127 Second, it also 
 
126 A mandatory rule is much more consistent  with the situation where a majority of 
investors do not demand climate disclosure, or where the level of demand for climate 
disclosure is uncertain. But these are not the grounds the SEC has put forward for the 
Proposed Rule. See infra notes 102-103 and accompanying text. 
127 For a discussion of the coordination function of law in establishing focal points, see 
generally Richard H. McAdams, A Focal Point Theory of Expressive Law , 86 V A. L. REV. 
1649 (2000). November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  29 
 implements  these standardized arrangements.128 Implementation will often 
be costly, difficult, and im practical for investors, and managers will often 
lack incentives to implement rules that are against their own private 
incentives.129 Implementing a rule for all comp anies, all at once, eliminates 
duplication of implementation costs.130 Third, an SEC rule also provides a 
centralized means of enforcement .131 This would be diff icult or impossible 
for companies to duplicate. Finally, among companies for which the rule 
does apply, there is standardization and centr alization of filings .132 It is 
completely reasonable for investors to  demand these features, and for the 
SEC to provide them, as each of th em would be costly, difficult, or 
impossible for investors to implement on their own. However, each of these 
features are also available in an investor-optional disclosure rule. 
D. Investor Demand and Investor optionality 
In contrast with a mandatory rule, an  investor-optional rule is entirely 
consistent with the investor demand ra tionale. If a substantial majority of 
investors in companies demand climate disclosure, those companies will not opt out of climate disclosure, and their demand for disclosure will continue 
to be met. But investor optionality is al so consistent with the claims of the 
critics of the SEC’s Proposed Rule, in a way that a mandatory rule is not. Critics have argued that there is less investor demand for climate disclosure 
than the SEC has claimed, and that much  of that demand is likely to be 
satisfied by existing disclosure.
133 Under an investor -optional rule, if 
investors do not actually require or demand all or  part of the climate 
disclosure in the Proposed Rule, and if  they believe the production of that 
 
128 If not implemented by the SEC, these arrangements would need to be implemented 
on a company-by-company basis, either by each company’s managers, or by their 
investors. See Hirst, supra  note 34, at 239  (discussing the econo mies of scale in 
implementation from a mandatory rule). 
129 For a discussion of the limitations to the implementation of corporate changes by 
investors and managers, see Hirst, supra  note 81, at 8–23. See also supra Section I.B. 
130 By implementation costs I refer to the costs to a company of putting a rule in place 
for that company, not the cost of actions that the company takes to comply  with that rule. 
131 See Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78u (2021) (authorizing 
investigations of violations by the SEC, and sanctions). 
132 For an argument for the centralization of voluntary filings on the SEC’s EDGAR 
database, see Andrew W. Winden, Jumpstarting Sustainability Disclosures , 76 B US. LAW. 
1215 (2021).  
133 See, e.g. , Cunningham et al., supra note 54, at 2  (arguing that there is insufficient 
investor demand to justify the SEC’s auth ority to promulgate a mandatory climate 
disclosure rule). November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  30 
disclosure will be more costly to them than the value it would provide, the 
company could opt out of the obligati on to disclose such information. 
By conditioning climate disclosure on investor demand, investor 
optionality thus resolves the tension between the competing claims of the 
SEC and its critics on the central questions of whether  investors actually 
demand climate disclosure, and what  disclosure they ac tually demand. That 
is, no matter which of the two sides is co rrect in its claims regarding investor 
demand for particular climat e disclosures (or the lack thereof), an investor-
optional rule would satisfy that side.134 For this reason, investor demand is 
not a compromise position; it gives bot h sides what they want, assuming 
their claims are accurate. Because i nvestor optionality would thus be 
consistent with the claims of the critics of the Proposed Rule (again, if those 
claims are accurate), it is also possibl e that it would lead many of them to 
drop their opposition to the Proposed Rule. 
Investor optionality is also the only practical way to resolve the tension 
between the two positions. The only alternative method would be for the SEC to undertake a rigorous and comp rehensive survey of investors to 
determine which investors demand wh at climate information. But this 
would be impractical—time consu ming, costly, and challenging to 
implement. And even if it were carried  out as well as possible, gaps—and 
doubts—are likely to remain.
135 In contrast, allowing investors to opt out of 
climate disclosure would reveal, for every company that proposed an opt-
out, whether a majority of investors actually supported all of the climate 
disclosure requirements at that particular company.136 If there were 
sufficient investor de mand at that company, it woul d be required to disclose. 
If investors at the company believed th at the costs of disclosure exceeded 
the benefits, they would opt out.137 
 
134 This would be what Alex Lee describes (with respect to the use of options in 
rulemaking) as allowing the “parties to ‘agree to disagree.’” See Lee, supra  note 68, at 904 . 
135 For instance, two major problems are that it would be very difficult, or impossible, to 
ask an investor to evaluate the applicability of the rules to every company in its portfolio; 
and that responses could be mere “cheap talk,” as there would be no consequences for 
overstating or understating preferences. For a discussion of cheap talk, see generally Joseph Farrell & Matthew Rabin, Cheap Talk , 10 J.
 ECON. PERSPS . 103 (1996). 
136 An opt-out vote would also avoid the cheap-talk problem mentioned in supra note 
135 because it would have actual consequences, determining whether the information is disclosed or not, and because investment managers are required to publicly disclose their 
votes, so they could be held accountable for them. 
137 This reasoning relies on the assumptions examined in infra Section IV.B. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  31 
 E. The Risks of Not Taking Investor Demand Seriously 
If the SEC does not take investor  demand seriously  by adopting an 
investor-optional rule, and instead ma kes its final rule mandatory, it would 
arm opponents of climate disc losure with a serious cl aim that the final rule 
would be invalid under the Ad ministrative Procedure Act.138 As I discuss 
further in Part III.E, the Administrat ive Procedure Act requires a reviewing 
court to set aside regulations th at are “arbitrary or capricious.”139 The U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has interpreted this 
standard as including decisions that re sult from “illogical” or inconsistent 
reasoning.140 For the reasons outlined above, the investor de mand rationale 
is inconsistent with the choice of a mandatory rule over an investor-optional 
rule, and such a choice would thus be “illogical.” 
If or when its final rule is challenged, the SEC will be forced to double 
down on its investor demand rationale to  justify its statutory authority to 
promulgate the final rule, against critics’ challenges of invalidity. But doing so would spotlight the question of the appropriateness and logical 
consistency of the decision to choose a mandatory rule over an investor-
optional rule. Conversely, because investor  demand is at the heart of several 
strong defenses against claims of in validity made regarding the Proposed 
Rule, the inconsistency between the investor demand rationale and the 
mandatory nature of the SEC’s rule will make it harder for the SEC to 
defend its rule against thos e claims of invalidity.
141 Given its reliance on the 
investor demand rationale, choosing a mandatory rule over an investor-
optional rule therefore locks the SEC in to a no-win position in the all-but-
inevitable judicial review of its final rule. 
III. CIRCUMVENTING CLAIMS OF INVALIDITY  
Many groups and individuals have ar gued that if the SEC adopted the 
Proposed Rule, it would be invalid. Howeve r, as this Part explains, if those 
arguments apply at all, they apply onl y to a mandatory climate disclosure 
 
138 5 U.S.C. §§ 551–559. 
139 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). 
140 See Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., Local 2924 v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 470 F.3d 
375, 380 (D.C. Cir. 2006). 
141 For a discussion of these claims generally, and how the Proposed Rule would be much 
better equipped to withstand them if it were investor-optional, see  infra Sections III.A-
III.D. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  32 
rule. Making the Proposed Rule invest or-optional would thus circumvent 
each of the main challenges to the validity of the ru le. Sections III.A-III.D 
summarize the most important claims  of invalidity made by opponents of 
the Proposed Rule and explain how inve stor optionality would circumvent 
each of them. In many cases, this is b ecause an investor-optional rule would 
only apply where there was demonstrat ed investor demand for climate 
disclosure. Section III.E explains that investor optionality would also 
operate as a sword, as well as a shie ld. Failure by the SEC to consider 
investor optionality is likely to be a strong ground for inva lidating the SEC’s 
final rule. And if the SEC does consid er investor optionality but nonetheless 
decides to make its final rule mandator y, it will face a hi gh bar to justify 
that decision. If it cannot, the final ru le would be subjec t to invalidation. 
Because investor optionality would circumvent important arguments of 
invalidity, it would be the best way for the SEC to protect investors.142 That 
is, if the SEC’s claims of substan tial investor demand are true, then 
investors will expect significant net benefits from a rule standardizing 
climate disclosure and pr oviding for enforcement (whe ther or not that rule 
is mandatory).143 The expected net benefit for investors is a function of the 
likelihood of the rule bei ng implemented. That bene fit to investors would 
be almost entirely eliminated if the Proposed Rule were invalidated.144 
Designing its Proposed Rule in such a way as to minimiz e the likelihood of 
invalidation is consistent with the in vestor demand rationale and should be 
an important part of the SEC’s calculus.145 
 
142 By arguing that investor optionality would circumvent claims of invalidity I do not 
mean to suggest that it is certain that a claim of invalidity against an investor-optional rule 
on these grounds would fail. For further discussion of this point, see supra note 148. 
143 A generalized version of this argument is Alex Lee’s discussion of how an “options 
approach” to rulemaking by the SEC would “increase the net expected benefit of going forward with a rule.” Lee, supra  note 68, at 887. 
144 There may remain some benefits to investor s even if the rule were invalidated. First, 
there is some possibility that the SEC could reintroduce the Proposed Rule in a way that overcame the sources of invalid ity, leaving some expectation of those benefits. Second, 
even if the rule were never implemented by the SEC, the choice of a standard may give both a focal point, and normative support, for investors seeking to implement disclosure 
on a company-by-company basis by private ordering, as was the case after the SEC’s proxy access rule was invalidated. For a discussion of  the benefits of including a back-stop opt-
in rule that would apply if other part s of a final rule we re invalidated, see infra Section 
V.F. 
145 For the SEC, weighing the potential invalidity of the Proposed Rule in a nuanced 
fashion is likely to be challenging. While it is required to disclose the factors it considers in choosing a rule, any acknowledgment of potential vulnerabilities of the Proposed Rule

 Before turning to consider th e potential grounds on which opponents 
have claimed that the SEC’s rule may be invalid, I note that by repeating 
these claims, I do not necessarily e ndorse them. A number of respected 
commentators have argued that many of these claims are inaccurate.146 I 
take no position on the correct ness of either the claims of invalidity, or these 
counter-claims, other than to recogni ze that the uncertainty regarding which 
are correct creates consequent uncertain ty about the validity of the Proposed 
Rule. The uncertainty regarding the validity of the Proposed Rule is 
accentuated by the fact that appellate courts have shown an increasing 
willingness to overturn long-settled precedent.147 Therefore, there remains 
some reasonable risk that an appellate court might uphold one or more of 
the claims of invalidity, notwithstan ding the strength of the arguments of 
those defending the Proposed Rule.148 
A. The Claim that Climate Disc losure is Compelled Speech 
Many critics of the Propos ed Rule have argued that the statements it 
would require regarding climate change would be compelled speech, in violation of the First Amendment rights of companies.
149 But this compelled 
speech claim applies, if at all, only  to a mandatory rule. I do not engage 
deeply with this claim here, because investor optionality would circumvent 
this line of att ack in a very straightforward way: disclosure would no longer 
 
could provide a pathway for attack by opponents of the Proposed Rule. This may explain 
why the SEC’s Release insists that it has stat utory authority for the Proposed Rule, without 
even recognizing any cl aims to the contrary. 
146 See, e.g. , Jill E. Fisch & George S. Georgiev, Comment Letter on Proposed Rule for 
Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors (June 6, 
2022), https://www.sec.gov/comments/s 71022-20130354-297375.pdf; John C. Coates,

147 The recently-endorsed “major questions” doctrine seems particularly well suited to 
this purpose. For further discussion of the major questions doctrine, see infra  Section III.C. 
For a discussion of the “discu rsive appropriation” of certain positions by appellate courts 
in a very different context, see Jonathan Feingold, Reclaiming CRT: How Regressive Laws 
Can Advance Progressive Ends, 73 S.C.  L. REV. 742, 742-47 (2022). 
148 Indeed, for the same reason, even if the SEC adopts an investor-optional disclosure 
rule, there remains some residual risk that an appellate court would invalidate the rule, notwithstanding the reasons presented in this  Article why the most important claims of 
invalidity would not apply to such a rule. 
149 See, e.g. , Griffith, supra  note 54; Cunningham et al., supra  note 54, at 14-15; Nat’l

be compelled  speech. Companies would not be compelled to speak, because 
they could opt out of the requirement.150 
Sean Griffith has put forward a novel variant on the compelled speech 
invalidity claim, arguing that past  Supreme Court decisions subject 
compelled speech to heightened sc rutiny where it is “controversial.”151 As 
well as the simple point that speech would not be “compelled,” investor 
optionality provides an additional strong response to Professor Griffith’s 
contention. Professor Griffith  concedes that “[d]isclosure mandates that are 
uncontroversially motivated to protect i nvestors are eligible for deferential 
judicial review.”152 Investor optionality woul d only require disclosure 
where investors had not opt ed out of it, creating a reasonable, probative—
and uncontroversial—basis to concl ude that investors regarded the 
disclosure as appropriate  for their protection. 
Of course, investor optionality would protect investors by only 
permitting opt-outs where investors ha d approved them, thus allowing 
investors to place limits on the speech of their compan ies. But the ability of 
investors to limit the speech of the corporations they invest in is 
uncontroversial, and was recogn ized by the Supreme Court in Citizens 
United  v. Federal Election Commission .153 
B. The Claim that Climate Disclo sure May Not Be Material 
Another set of attacks on  the Proposed Rule are based on the claim that 
disclosure of climate-related informati on is not material. On e version of this 
attack is that the SEC does not have the power to require disclosure of non-
material matters, so cannot require disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions. 
Another version of this attack is that, because the information is not material 
to investors, the Proposed Rule cannot be “necessary or appropriate . .  . for 
 
150 Technically, the company may need to enga ge in some modest amount of speech to 
opt-out—at a minimum, by putting forward a prop osal in its proxy materials for investors 
to vote on. The requirements of proxy statements would also require a certain amount of 
description of the proposal. See 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a-101, Item 20 (requiring companies to 
describe the substance of matters proposed at meetings). This would also require the 
company to expend some amount of resources to avoid speech, though as discussed in infra 
Section IV.B.4 , the incremen tal cost to the company of preparing and including such 
information is likely to be very small.

 the protection of invest ors”, and therefore falls outside the SEC’s 
authority.154 
Critics cite the standard definition of materiality, put forward in TSC 
Industries, Inc. v Northway, Inc. , where the Supreme Court held that a 
matter is “material” if it “would have been viewed by the reasonable 
investor as having significantly altered the “total mix” of information made 
available.”155 Critics claim that the clim ate disclosure required by the 
Proposed Rule is not material, becau se reasonable investors would not 
consider it in making investment decisions.156 
Leaving aside the validity of this claim, whether i nvestors would or 
would not consider such emissions is an empirica l question. Many investors 
have advocated for a climate disclo sure rule, which suggests that a 
reasonable investor would consider it in their investment decisions.157 The 
SEC has used these letters to support its claim that there is investor demand for climate disclosure. Ne vertheless, critics of the rule have argued that 
investors supporting climate disclosure are not representative of investors 
in general, and so (presumably) th eir views should not be probative in 
determining the views of a “reasonable investor.”
158 
Investor optionality provides a compel ling answer to this line of attack: 
it lets investors in a particular company actually decide whether a particular 
company is obligated to disclose its e missions. If investors in a particular 
company do not consider particular climate-related information material, 
they can authorize the company to opt out  of its obligations to disclose that

information. Conversely, th at a majority of inve stors in a particular 
company do not support opting out of emissions disclosure can be taken as 
reasonable and probative evidence that the information is material to a 
reasonable investor, and therefore, that  the SEC is entitled to require its 
disclosure.159 Indeed, a decision by investors whether or not to opt out of 
climate disclosure is likely to be much better evidence of the views of 
reasonable investors on the ma teriality of climate-related disclosure than the 
assertions of the SEC in the Release, or  those of critics of the Proposed Rule, 
or even than the views of an appell ate court reviewing the validity of the 
climate disclosure rule the SEC eventually adopts. 
C. Claims that the SEC La cks Statutory Authority 
Critics have made two different argu ments that the SEC lacks statutory 
authority to require climate disclo sure. One argument is that climate 
disclosure is not part of the category of  disclosure that the SEC is authorized 
to require under the Securities Act of  1933 or the Securiti es Exchange Act 
of 1934.160 A second argument is that cl imate disclosure  is a “major 
question” which would require express Congressional authorization for 
rulemaking.161 Below I consider each of these arguments in turn. 
The first of these arguments is base d on the claim that the matters that 
both statutes initially required to be di sclosed related to the finances of the 
company, and to the extent the SEC has since required disclosure of broader matters, those were authorized specifically by statute.
162 Opponents of the 
Proposed Rule argue that emissions information does not relate to the 
finances of the company, and so—wit hout explicit statutory authorization—
falls outside the im plicit ambit of th e securities laws.163 
 
159 This evidence is likely to be particularly persuasive as there would be little or no other 
contrary evidence, specific to the partic ular company, that the information was not material 
to the investors in the compan y. I am grateful to David Webber for making clear the 
importance of this point. 
160 Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77 a–77aa (2021); Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78a–78qq (2021). 
161 See, e.g. , Peirce, supra note 103;  Andrew N. Vollmer, Comment Letter on Proposed 
Rule for The Enhancement and Standardiza tion of Climate-Related Disclosures for 
Investors (Apr. 12, 2022), https://www.s ec.gov/comments/s7-10-22/s71022-20123525-
279742.pdf; Cunningham et al., supra note 54. 
162 See Vollmer, supra  note 161, at 10–11 (discussing “statutory authorizations [by 
Congress] to expand mandatory disclosure beyond the topics already covered in the 
Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act.”). 
163 See, e.g. , Id. at 6–11 (discussing the “statutory context” for the authorization of SEC 
rulemaking power). November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  37 
 A group of law professors have challenged the validity of these 
claims.164 But even assuming that the claims are valid, they turn entirely on 
the question of what types of disclosure the securities laws permits the SEC 
to require. There are a number of di fferent answers to this question.165 
Instead of a narrow definition of financ ial matters, a better description of 
the matters required to be disclosed by the Securities Act of 1933 and the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is things that inves tors considered 
material in making investment or voting decisions. As well as matters 
required to be disclosed by the statutes as originally enacted, this category 
would also other disclosure items that the SEC has subsequently and 
required without controversy. But th ere remains the question whether 
investors consider climate disclosure  material for inve stment or voting 
decisions. An investor-optional disclosu re rule would clea rly answer this 
question, in the same way described in  Section III.B: to the extent that 
investors do not find climate disclosu re material, or even sufficiently 
material that it is worth the cost of disclosure, they can opt out of the rule. 
Therefore, the fact that a company ha s not opted out strongly suggests that 
its investors consider the information material in making financial decisions.
166 Because the information is releva nt and material to investors, 
it is functionally no different from other information that the SEC has 
required to be disclosed in past rulemaking. 
A related argument made by opponents of the Proposed Rule is that 
climate disclosure relates to a “major question,” and is therefore governed 
by a nascent “major questions doctrine.”167 These opponents claim that for 
regulators to make rules relating to  a major question requires express

applicable disclosure regulation. For a discussion of this assumption, see infra Section 
IV.B.2.

statutory approval.168 This argument has gained  strength fo llowing the 
Supreme Court’s decision in West Virginia v. Environmental Protection 
Agency (hereinafter, “ West Virginia ”), which recognized the major 
questions doctrine, and applied it to strike down an Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) rule related to climate emissions.169 A number of 
commentators have since argued that th e major questions doctrine is likely 
to play a major role in  determining the validity of the Proposed Rule.170 
As articulated in the decision of Chief Justice Roberts, the major 
questions doctrine describes a “reluc tan[ce] to read into an ambiguous 
statutory text” a delegation to an ag ency of “highly consequential power 
beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted.”171 
In such a case, “something more than a merely plausible textual basis for 
the agency action is necessary. The agency instead must point to “clear 
congressional authorization” for the power  it claims.172 This will apply 
where there is a broad claim of author ity by the agency, that represents a 
substantial departure from past  practice and regulatory norms.173 In a 
concurring opinion, Justice Gorsuch (joi ned by Justice Alito) added several 
additional factors, including whether th e matter is of “great political 
significance” and subject to “earnest and profound debate,” and whether the 
agency “seeks to regulate a significant portion of the American economy” 
or require “billions of dollars in spending by private persons or entities.”174 
Whether the major questions doctrine could be used to invalidate the 
Proposed Rule turns on whether the doc trine applies to the facts of the

 Proposed Rule, and if so, whether the authorization of SE C rulemaking in 
the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are 
sufficiently clear.  
Regarding the first question, several commentators have suggested that 
there is a significant likelihood that the major questions doctrine would 
apply.175 They point to the national debate regarding climate change, the 
impact that the Proposed Rule would have  not just on disclosing companies, 
but on private companies with which th ey do business, the substantial costs 
of compliance, and several failed Congr essional attempts to pass legislation 
authorizing the SEC to re quire climate disclosure.176 Of course, others have 
pointed to reasons why the SEC’s acti ons in the Proposed Rule are much 
narrower than those of the EPA in West Virginia to argue that the major 
questions doctrine would not apply.177 But it is important to note that the 
majority opinion in West Virginia characterized the EPA’s actions as 
sufficiently broad to apply the major questions doctrine, even though a 
much narrower characterization of those actions was available.178 This 
suggests a significant possibility that—faced with two conflicting 
interpretations of the breadth of th e SEC’s disclosure—a  reviewing court 
could take the more expansive interpretation. 
The critical point that the SEC will need  to establish is that its disclosure 
obligations relate to the investor pr otection, rather than  fighting climate 
change, and that they are closely ta ilored to protect investor needs.179 
Investor optionality would substantiall y assist the SEC in making this case. 
 
175 See, e.g. , Mascianica, Magee & Athenour, supra  note 170 (arguing that “if the [SEC] 
finalizes the rule in similar form, it’s likely the Court would find the major question 
doctrine applies.”).  
176 See Thomas, Olmem, & Merick, supra  note 170; Mascianica, Magee, & Athenour, 
supra  note 170. 
177 See, e.g. , Jonathan D. Uslaner & Will Horowitz, Will the SEC’s Proposed Climate 
Risk Disclosure Rules Survive Supreme Court Scrutiny? , R EUTERS , Aug. 5, 2022, 
https://www.reuters.com/legal/le galindustry/will-secs-propose d-climate-risk-disclosure-
rules-survive-supreme- court-scrutiny-2022-08-05/ (sugges ting “compelling reasons . . . to 
believe the Supreme Court’s reasoning in West Virginia will not impact the SEC’s 
proposed climate change disclosure rules”).  
178 Indeed, Justice Kagan, in her dissenting opinion, made just such a characterization, 
one that she argued fitted within the EPA’s statutory authority.  See West Virginia v. EPA, 
597 U.S. __, slip op. at 19-28 (U.S. June 30, 2022). 
179 See Farber, supra  note 173  (“The crucial question . . . is whether the SEC can make 
a convincing case that its goals relate to the securities market, not to fighting climate change . . . . This will require . . . a regulation that is carefully crafted to protect investor 
needs.”).   November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  40 
Investor optionality would limit the ambit of the Proposed Rule to 
companies whose investors were not willing to opt out of the obligation. 
The Proposed Rule could thus not be characterized as requiring companies 
to disclose climate risk for the br oad purpose of fighting climate change, 
which could be the subject of national debate. Instead, it would only require 
companies to give their investors information that the company could very 
reasonably infer that those investors be lieved would be ma terial to them. 
This is consistent with the SEC’s past rulemaking, and far from a substantial departure from past SEC actions. 
D. Claims Regarding Cost-Benefit Analysis 
A further line of attack against the Proposed Rule is that the SEC has 
not conducted appropriate or sufficient  economic analysis of the Proposed 
Rule—that they have not sufficiently considered its costs, and/or its benefits—and that the economic analys is that the SEC has conducted does 
not justify the imposition of mandatory climate disclosure.
180 This may be 
a particularly challenging claim for the SEC to rebut, because there is no 
agreed-upon understanding of just how much  cost-benefit analysis is 
sufficient, and therefore no limit to the potential analysis that could be undertaken.
181 
Commentators have also suggested that the SEC’s economic analysis 
understates the high costs of the Pr oposed Rule, or th at the highly 
speculative (and unquantifiable) benefits cannot justify the high costs of the 
Proposed Rule.182 Similar reasoning has been sufficient grounds to 
invalidated prior rulemaking by the SEC.183 On its face, this is also a 
difficult claim for the SEC to rebut, becau se the costs of a proposed rule are 
generally concrete, and thus much eas ier to quantify. Most costs of the 
Proposed Rule accrue to particular companies with accounting systems to 
determine their quantum. In contrast, the benefits from the Proposed Rule 
that the SEC identifies would accrue to a broad group of investors, which 
cannot quantify those benefits.184 
 
180 See, e.g. , Cunningham et al., supra note 54, at 15–16. 
181 For a discussion of the challenges of cost-benefit analysis, see generally John C. 
Coates, Cost-Benefit Analysis of Financial Regulation: Case Studies and Implications , 124 
YALE L.J. 882 (2015). 
182 See, e.g. , Cunningham et al., supra note 54, at 15–16. 
183 See, e.g. , Business Roundtable v. SEC, 647 F.3d 1144 (D.C. Cir. 2011). 
184 For a detailed study of arguments regarding cost-benefit analysis by the SEC, see 
Coates, supra  note 181. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  41 
 Making the Proposed Rule invest or-optional would effectively 
circumvent these criticisms, for two reasons.185 First, it would cap the net 
costs of the Proposed Rule to investor s in a particular company at a very 
low level.186 If the Proposed Rule imposed gr eater costs than benefits on 
investors in the company, and costs (net of benefits) were greater than the 
cost of opting-out, investors would s imply opt out, capping the costs to 
investors at the relatively  low cost of opting out.187 The maximum overall 
costs of the Proposed Rule would thus be costs of opt-outs, aggregated over 
all of those companies that would opt  out (or attempt to do so). The per-
company costs are likely to be simila r and small for each company: they 
would consist of the marginal cost to the company of including an additional 
proposal in its a nnual report, and the marginal  cost to the company’s 
investors of voting on that proposal. These costs of opting out could be 
reliably estimated by the SEC.188 They are likely to be relatively small, and 
orders of magnitude less than the amounts the SEC estimated as the costs 
of gathering and preparing the requir ed climate disclosure information.189 
Second, by its very design, an investo r-optional rule w ould provide clear 
evidence that the benefits of the Pr oposed Rule would exceed the costs.190 
For any company where investors believed that the costs of climate disclosure would exceed the benefits they would receive from disclosure, 
those investors would allow the comp any to opt out of the disclosure 
obligation. Therefore, if a company ha s not opted out, the benefits of 
disclosure to investors in the compa ny can be reasonably inferred to be 
greater than the costs to those investors of such disclosure.
191 Similarly, the 
 
185 For a prior discussion of how an “options-approach” to rulemaking would help 
agencies—and the SEC in particular—avoid invalidation or insufficient cost-benefit 
analysis, see Lee, supra note 68, at 928 (discussing how an opt-out would have reduced 
the likelihood of invalidation of the SEC’s proxy access rule). 
186 For a version of these arguments in reference to SEC rulemaking in general, see 
generally Hirst, supra note 34 . 
187 See id.  at 270–71. 
188 For a discussion of the costs of opting out, see infra  Section IV.B.4. 
189 For the SEC’s discussion of the likely cost s of climate disclosure, see Proposed Rule, 
supra note 2, at 21339–43. A number of commenta tors have suggested that these are likely 
to underestimate the true costs of disclosure. See, e.g. , Nat’l Ass’n of Mfrs., supra  note 55, 
at 3 (arguing that the Proposed Rule “fails to appropriately take into account . . . the time 
and cost burden associated with th e rule’s far-reaching mandates.”). 
190 See Hirst, supra  note 34, at 261, 272 . 
191 As discussed above, this inference is not certain, but it would be stronger than any 
competing inference that could be drawn regarding the views of investors in the company regarding climate disclosure. See supra note 159. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  42 
overall benefits of the Proposed Rule for all of the companies that did not 
opt out could reasonably be inferred to be greater th an the costs of the rule. 
Given the very small cost to any co mpanies that do opt out, capped at the 
cost of the opt out pro cess, it would be straig htforward for the SEC to 
conclude that the benefits to investors of an investor-ordered rule exceeded the costs. The result would be to give  much greater confid ence to the SEC’s 
economic analysis, and thus reduce th e likelihood that a reviewing court 
would later find it inadequate.

E. Failure to Adequately Consider or Rebut Investor optionality 
Investor optionality could operate not only as a shield for a final rule (if 
it were so designed), but also as a sword, against a final rule that is not 
investor-optional. There are two ways that failure to take into investor 
optionality into account could lead to invalidity of a mandatory final climate 
disclosure rule. First, a final rule ad opted by the SEC is likely to be invalid 
if the SEC does not consider an investor-optional rule in its final 
rulemaking. Second, if the SEC does adopt a mandatory rule rather than an 
investor-optional rule, it  must adequately justify the grounds on which it 
chose to do so, and why arguments that investor optionality would be better 
for investors do not hold. If it cannot, such  a mandatory rule is also likely 
to be invalid. 
These two potential grounds for inva lidity differ fro m the arguments 
outlined in previous sections in that have not yet been argued by opponents of the Proposed Rule, but rather derive from the analysis in this Article. However, opponents of the SEC’s rule making are likely to use whatever 
arguments they can find in their attempt to invalidate the SEC’s rule. These arguments are unlikely to escape their at tention, either from this Article 
itself, or comment letters submitted to the SEC, or a related blog post, each encapsulating similar arguments re garding investor optionality.
193 If the 
SEC does not strengthen its Proposed Ru le by making it inve stor-optional, 
that failure is likely to  be used against it by oppon ents of the Proposed Rule, 
as a strong argument for invalidation.

 The first way in which investor optiona lity could be used as a basis for 
invalidating a final, mandatory SEC rule is if the SEC fails to consider  
investor optionality before adopting a final rule. The reasoning is 
straightforward. Cases interpreting th e Administrative Procedure Act have 
made clear that the SEC is required to  consider reasonable alternatives to 
its Proposed Rules, and especially “le ss restrictive yet eas ily administered” 
regulatory alternatives.194 Investor-optional disc losure is clearly a 
reasonable alternative, and also one th at is less restrictive, yet easily 
administered. If the SEC failed to cons ider investor-optional disclosure, it 
would therefore be grounds for inva lidating the rule the SEC adopts. 
There is clear precedent applying this requirement to the SEC and 
invalidating prior SEC rulemaki ng for failure to comply. In Chamber of 
Commerce of the United States of America v. SEC (hereinafter, “Chamber 
of Commerce ”), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
Circuit invalidated an SEC rule based (i n part) on its failur e to consider an 
alternative to the rule, which the C ourt concluded was a violation of the 
Administrative Procedure Act.195 Chamber of Commerce relied on a 
standard set out in the Supreme Court’s decision in Motor Vehicle Mfrs. 
Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co (hereinafter, “ State Farm ”).196 The 
Sixth Circuit has applied the State Farm  standard to conclude that failures 
by the regulator to consider “less restrictive, yet easily administered” alternative rules rendered a rule arbitrary.
197 
The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has clarified 
that the State Farm  standard does not require the SEC to consider every  
alternative;198 the SEC would be excused from considering alternatives that 
are “for whatever reason, unworthy of consideration.”199 But in Chamber of

as to why the less restrictive alternatives . . . are insufficient” and as a result, the rule 
adopted by the FCC was arbitrary).

Commerce, the Court concluded th at the alternative proposed was “neither 
frivolous nor out of bou nds, and the SEC therefor e had an obligation to 
consider it.”200  
As this Article has explained, investor -optional disclosure is also neither 
frivolous nor out of bounds. Far from be ing “unworthy of consideration,” 
Part II demonstrates that investor optionality is more  consistent with the 
SEC’s rationale for promulgating a climate disclosure rule than mandatory 
disclosure, and Part IV makes the case that it is highly likely to better protect 
investors than a mandatory rule. The Re lease considered 14 variations on 
the Proposed Rule, all of which are substantially less likely  to be better for 
investors than an investor-optional alternative.201 Letters submitted in 
response to the SEC’s reque st for comments on the Pr oposed Rule have also 
made clear the reasons why investor- optional would be more consistent 
with investor demand, a nd offer better protection for investors, than a 
mandatory rule.202 In the past the SEC has considered an opt-out alternative 
to at least one proposed rule, its rule implementing proxy access.203 All of 
these facts add weight to the argument that, for the SEC to heedlessly fail to consider the investor-optional alternative would be grounds for 
invalidating a mandatory rule. 
If the SEC does consider investor optionality, then in order to 
nonetheless implement mandatory disc losure it would need a good reason 
to justify its conclusion that mand atory disclosure would be better for 
investors than investor optionality. It must “articulate a satisfactory 
explanation for its action including a ‘rational connection between the facts 
found and the choice made.’”
204 The SEC’s rulemaking would be arbitrary 
and capricious, and therefore, s ubject to invalidation under the 
Administrative Procedure Act 
if the agency has relied  on factors which Congress 
has not intended it to cons ider, entirely failed to

implausible that it coul d not be ascribed to a 
difference in view or the product of agency expertise.
205 
Two of the arguments made in this Artic le mean that it is likely to be 
very challenging for the SEC to satisfy  these standards, and to adequately 
justify implementing a mandatory rule ra ther than an inve stor-optional rule. 
First, as discussed in Part II, a manda tory rule is not consistent with the 
SEC’s claim of investor demand, on which its rulemaking is based. It would 
therefore be very difficult, or impossible, for the SEC to articulate a 
satisfactory explanation for choosing a mandatory rule, or a rational 
connection between investor demand and the choice of a mandatory rule 
(rather than an investor- optional rule). Rather, gi ven the investor demand 
rationale, the choice of a mandatory ru le over an investor-optional rule 
would be inconsistent and illogical.206 
Second, it is highly likely that in vestor-optional disclosure will better 
protect investors than manda tory disclosure. Part IV explains why this is 
likely to be the case, and the very li mited circumstances in which it would 
not be the case. As Part IV.C e xplains, the only ground on which a 
mandatory rule could be better for investors than an  investor-optional rule 
is if the SEC were to conclude, both that (1) there would be a substantial 
number of companies where investors would choose to opt out if they were 
able to do so, and (2) the cost to investors outside those companies  from the 
decisions of those companies to opt out  would be greater than all of the 
other benefits to investors from investor optionality, including cost savings 
from opt-out decisions, a nd the greater likelihood of validity of climate 
disclosure rules.207 
If the SEC implemented a mandatory rule without adducing sufficient 
evidence to overcome the argument that an investor-optional rule would be 
better for investors,  then its mandatory final rule would be subject to 
invalidation for being arbitrary and capricious.208 And if the SEC were to

choose a mandatory rule over an invest or-optional rule on any grounds that 
did not relate to invest or protection (or to the promotion of efficiency, 
competition, and capital formation), then its reliance “on factors which 
Congress has not intended it to consider” would al so make their decision 
subject to invalidation as  arbitrary and capricious.209 
IV. A BETTER RULE FOR INVESTORS  
This Part makes the case that invest or-optional disclosu re is likely to 
result in better protection for investors than a mandatory rule. Obviously, 
given that its rulemaking power is granted for the purpose of protecting 
investors, the SEC should implement the version of the rule that would be 
better for investors. If the SEC none theless wished to implement a 
mandatory rule, it must demonstrate that  the mandatory rule would actually 
be better for investors. This Part e xplains what the SEC would need to 
establish in order to demonstrate that , and why it is like ly to be very 
challenging. Section IV.A explains that investor-optional climate disclosure 
would have costs for inve stors in disclosing companies that are no greater 
than those imposed by the Proposed Rule, and probably significantly less. 
Section IV.B explains the assumptions on which this analysis relies, and 
why they are likely to be reasonabl e. The critical question regarding 
whether a mandatory rule or an invest or-optional rule wi ll be better for 
investors thus comes down to potential benefits for investors outside the 
disclosing company, and whether those outweigh the costs of such disclosure to the disclosing company’s investors. Section IV.C outlines how 
this question must be analyzed, in cluding by the SEC if it wishes to 
implement a mandatory rule. Section IV.D considers a dditional benefits 
from the information likely to be re vealed by an invest or-optional rule. 
A. Lower Costs for Investors in Disclosing Companies 
This Section makes the straightforw ard case for why investor-optional 
disclosure would be better than a mandatory rule for investors in a company 
subject to disclosure requirements . A focus on investors within the 
company is consistent with a substantial part of the SEC’s argument that 
there is investor demand for climate disclosure: most of that demand is 
likely to come from investors w ithin the company. This includes 
 
209 Id. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  47 
 information that these investors will use for voting or stewardship purposes, 
and also in deciding whether to sell their shares.210 For rules with little or 
no effects on investors outside the comp any to which the rule applies, this 
analysis would be the end of the matter.211 However, since the Proposed 
Rule relates to disclosure rule, it is reasonable to consider whether that 
disclosure may have benefits to investors outside the company. Such 
potential externality benefits ar e introduced in Section IV.C.  
When considering only investors in the disclosing company, it is clear 
why an investor-optional rule will be  no worse, and often better, than a 
mandatory rule. Consider two mutually exclusive and collectively 
exhaustive scenarios. In the first scenario the benefits of the Proposed Rule 
for investors in all companies subject to  the Proposed Rule are greater than 
the costs of the Proposed Rule for those investors. In this scenario, no set of 
rational company investors would a pprove an opt-out from the Proposed 
Rule. Thus, the benefits and costs of an investor-optional rule would be 
identical to those of the Proposed Rule. 
Now consider the complementary scenario, where the costs to investors 
in at least some companies of disclosure are greater than the benefits to 
investors in those companies from disclosure. This is a much more reasonable scenario, because there is likely to be variation among 
companies in the costs and benefits from disclosure to investors in those 
companies. The Release itself contem plates such variation, by treating 
small reporting companies (SRCs) differently from other companies subject to the Proposed Rule.
212 But costs and benefits are also likely to vary among 
both SRCs and non-SRCs, depending on f actors like the level of emissions 
 
210 The Release makes clear that the purpose of  the Proposed Rule is to help investors 
“make investment or voting decisions.” Proposed Rule, supra note 2, at 21432. Indeed, the 
SEC includes this phrase 21 times throughout the Release. See id. at 21335, 21337, 21341, 
21360–61, 21368, 21371, 21373, 21376–77, 21379–80, 213405, 21413, 21425, 21432, 
21462. 
211 For instance, that is likely to be the case for governance rules, such as those relating 
to the composition of the company’s board of directors or board committees. This would 
also include any requirements  the SEC might impose in the future regarding board 
diversity. See, e.g. , Andrew Ramonas, SEC’s Board Diversity Drive Runs Risk of More 
Legal Challenges , B LOOMBERG L. (Oct. 22, 2021), https ://news.bloomberglaw.com/
securities-law/secs-board-diversity-dri ve-runs-risk-of-more-legal-challenges. 
212 Proposed Rule, supra note 2, at 21390–91  (describing the proposed exemption of 
SRCs from the requirement to disclose Scope 3 emissions). November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  48 
of the company, the costs to the company of disclosure, and the composition 
of the company’s investors.213 
At many companies, the benefits to investors from disclosure will still 
exceed the cost of that disclosure, and investors in those companies will not 
authorize the company to opt out of the rule. But for those companies where 
benefits to investors from the Proposed Rule are less than the costs they 
would bear from the Proposed Rule, th en if the Proposed Rule is made 
investor-optional, investors in those companies will support the company opting out of the Proposed Rule. This will result in lower costs to those 
investors compared to a mandatory ru le. An investor-optional rule would 
therefore also be less costly than a mandatory rule for investors in the 
aggregate, across all companies. The ups hot is that investor optionality will 
be no worse (for investors in disclosi ng companies) than a mandatory rule, 
and likely better. This is unsurprisin g, since it follows from the assumption 
that, where rational investors have the ability to do so, they will act in their 
own interests. 
B. The Reasonable Assumptions for Lower Cost Disclosure 
The reasoning in Section IV.A ma kes several additional assumptions, 
which I examine in turn below.
214 As the discussion shows, not only are 
these assumptions reasonable, but they are consistent with the SEC’s own claims and assumptions, including regarding investor demand. It is 
therefore unlikely that the SEC could conclude that they were inaccurate in a way that would undermine the base case for investor optionality being better for investors in disclosing companies than a mandatory rule, without 
also undermining its own rationale for its Proposed Rule. 
1. Investors Vote for the Outcomes that Are Best for Investors 
The reasoning in Section IV.A assume s that, when deciding whether to 
opt out of climate disclo sure, investors will vote for the choice that will 
 
213 The benefits to investors are also likely to vary based on the composition of the 
investor base. I discuss the implications of this further in infra Section VI.A. 
214 In addition, I assume that the SEC would design the opt-out process in such a way as 
to be optimally protective of investors, following the approach discussed in Part V. This is 
not an unreasonable assumption; the design of the rule is entirely within the control of the 
SEC, and the SEC has strong incentives to de sign the rule so as to protect investors. 
Following the approach in Part V would ensure that investors were adequately protected from opt-outs by minority shareholders that control companies with dual-class stock even 
where investors did not consider it in their best interests to opt out. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  49 
 maximize their own future welfare.215 If they do, they will opt out when the 
costs to investors exceed the benefits of the rule, and they will choose not 
to opt out if the benefits exceed the cost. 
If investors do not make pr ivately optimal choices, it is possible that an 
investor-optional rule might be wo rse at protecting investors than a 
mandatory rule. Of course, if investors wrongly failed to opt out of an 
investor-optional rule, th e disclosure obligation w ould continue to apply, 
just as it would for a mandatory rule.216 So the assumption of privately 
optimal decision making on the part of investors can only affect the 
conclusion that investor-optional rules are better for investors if investors 
would consistently opt out  of disclosure rules against their own interests.217 
They would only do this if they do not recognize the benefit of climate 
disclosure for themselves.218 
But the possibility that investor s would opt out against their own 
interests is contrary to the claims of both the SEC and its opponents 
regarding the Proposed Rule. The SE C has relied on investor demand for 
climate disclosure to promulgate the Proposed Rule.219 Doing so implicitly 
 
215 Any voting solution conjures the possibility of voting paradoxes, such as that 
identified by Condorcet, and of Arrow’s impossibility theorem. For a discussion of both 
topics, see, e.g., Eric Pacuit, Voting Methods , in THE STANFORD ENCYCLOPEDIA OF 
PHILOSOPHY  (Edward N. Zalta ed., Fall 2019 ed. 2019). This a problem common to all 
corporate voting issues where there is the possibility of a cycle. The Condorcet paradox thus applies if there was a voting choice among multiple different decisions. But because 
the opt-out vote proposed in this Article would be binary, there is no possibility of cyclicality as in the Condorcet paradox. In addition, the Condorcet paradox is unlikely to 
hold in elections with large numbers of voters, such as corporate elections. See A. S. 
Tangian, Unlikelihood of Condorcet’s Paradox in a Large Society , 17 S
OC. CHOICE 
WELFARE  337, 350 (2000) . 
216 In such a case, the welfare of investors ma y be worse than if there was no obligation 
on the company at all, but that would not be a reason to prefer the mandatory rule over the 
investor-optional rule. 
217 To make investor optionality worse than a mandatory rule, the extent of sub-optimal 
decision making would need to be extreme, such that the costs from it outweighed the other 
benefits of investor optionality. 
218 It is possible that the SEC’s choice to have disclosure as the default (rather than no 
disclosure as the default) may give the case for disclosure extra credibility, and thus bias 
decisions of investors against opting out. However, this would seem to be unlikely for the 
large majority of investors th at are sophisticated institutions, and able to make their own 
rational decisions. If, as SEC claims, the deci sion to impose climate disclosure already 
follows the preferences of a majority of investor s, then there is no room for the choice of a 
disclosure default to change their views. In any case, any bias would be conservative, making the opt-out rule more like a mandatory rule, albeit reducing the potential cost 
reductions from companies opting out. 
219 See infra  Section II.A. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  50 
assumes that investors are able to correctly identify the costs and benefits 
that climate disclosure would have for them.220 If so, they can do the same 
when making opt out decisions.221 And if the majority of investors do indeed 
demand climate disclosure, they will  not wrongly opt out of it. Opponents 
of the Proposed Rule acknowledge that many investors support the rule; these opponents are thus mo re likely to be concer ned that investors would 
fail to opt out, rather than wrongly opt out. For those investors to wrongly 
opt out it would be necessary that cl imate disclosure was actually in the 
interests of those voting to opt out, despite their belief to the contrary. 
An additional argument raised by opponents of the Proposed Rule is that 
investment managers supporting climat e disclosure are not following the 
true preferences of their own investors.
222 One explanation is agency costs 
of investment managers. It is certai nly likely that investment managers 
exhibit some agency costs in both th eir stewardship decisions and their 
voting decisions.223 However, the direction in which the SEC’s opponents 
claim those agency costs push investor s would make an investor-optional 
rule more like a mandatory rule, rather than worse than a mandatory rule. 
That is because the agency cost argument of those opponents is that 
investment managers are more likely to support climate disclosure than 
their own investors would prefer.224 If this were to lead  them to act against 
the interests of their in vestors, it would be by failing to opt out, not by 
wrongly opting out. This would reduce th e extent to which investor 
 
220 If investors could not identify the costs and benefits that climate disclosure would 
have for them it would not be reasonable to rely on their demands for such disclosure. 
221 Investors considering opt-out decisions will also have the benefit of the reasoning the 
SEC has expressed in the Proposed Rule regarding the costs and benefits of climate 
disclosure, and will be able to assess whether that reasoning applies to the particular company in which they invest. 
222 See, e.g. , Cunningham et al., supra note 54, at 5–7. 
223 For a discussion of agency costs of institutional investors with respect to stewardship 
decisions, see generally Lucian A. Bebchuk, Alma Cohen & Scott Hirst, The Agency 
Problems of Institutional Investors , 31 J.  ECON. PERSP . 89 (2017); Lucian Bebchuk & Scott 
Hirst, Index Funds and the Future of Corporate Governance: Theory, Evidence, and 
Policy , 119 C OLUM . L. REV. 2029 (2019). For evidence that investment managers do not 
follow the preferences of their own investors, see Scott Hirst, Social Responsibility 
Resolutions , 43 J.  CORP. L. 217 (2018). 
224 For my own argument that investment managers do not follow the preferences of their 
own investors, see Hirst, supra note 223. However, that Article points out that investment 
managers were likely to be insufficiently su pportive of socially responsible matters, like 
climate disclosure, rather than excessively su pportive, as opponents of the Propose Rule 
argue. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  51 
 optionality is better for investor than  a mandatory rule, but would not make 
investor optionality wors e than a mandatory rule.225 
2. Opt-outs Are Initiated When They Would Be Beneficial 
A second critical assumption of the reasoning in Part  IV.A is that, where 
there is a reasonable chance that invest ors would vote to opt out of climate 
disclosure, a vote will indeed be init iated to opt out of the disclosure 
obligation. If such votes are not actua lly initiated, companies will continue 
to be bound by those obligations even though they are costly to investors. 
It is important to note that the failu re of this assumption would not make 
an investor-optional worse than a mandatory rule. At the extreme, if opt out 
votes were never initiated, the investo r-optional and mandatory versions of 
the rule would be identical. But the extent to which opt-outs from the 
Proposed Rule are not initiated will reduce the margin by which the 
investor-optional rule is better than the mandatory rule (all other things 
being equal). 
Opt-outs are likely to be initiated where they are expected to be 
successful, because the directors and executives of the company have the ability to easily initiate opt out votes, strong incentives to do so if they are 
beneficial, and no si gnificant incentives not to do so.
226 For directors and 
executives, initiating an opt-out vote would be easy and inexpensive. It 
would simply require including an additio nal matter in the agenda and proxy 
materials for an annual sh areholder meeting as part  of the registrant’s 
regular annual meeting preparation pr ocess. Directors and executives are 
the ones most likely to push for opting out fro m the company’s disclosure 
obligations. As Nell Minow artfully describes in her comment letter 
regarding the Proposed Rule, “the only group who can object to the 
 
225 If this objection is indeed correct, it could be overcome by implementing an investor-
optional rule in conjunction with stronger requirements or incentives for institutional 
investors to follow the preferences of their own investors. For such a proposal, see 
generally id.  
226 Under-initiation of opt-out votes would be likely if investors were required to initiate 
those opt-out votes, given the costs to investors of initiating shareholder votes, their limited incentives to do so, and th eir resources constraints. See Hirst, supra note 81. This is the 
main reason to make the rule opt-out, rather than opt-in—to give directors and executives 
the incentive to initiate the voting decision. See Hirst, supra  note 34; Bebchuk & Hamdani, 
supra  note 79 . November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  52 
proposed rule are corporate execu tives and board members . . .”.227 They 
are the group that are most familiar with the costs of the disclosure. Indeed, 
many managers and groups associated with managers submitted comments 
in opposition to the SEC’s Proposed Rule on the grounds that it would impose excessive costs on companies.
228 If directors or executives believe 
that an opt-out is likely to be suppor ted by investors, they therefore have 
both the ability and the incentive to put forward such an opt-out for a vote. 
The only reason that directors and ex ecutives might be deterred from 
initiating opt out votes that  they expect to be successful is from a fear of 
obloquy from doing so. But this possi bility seems far-fetched. If 
shareholders holding a majority of shar es (or even a substantial minority) 
were likely to support the opt out proposal , sufficient for it to be successful, 
that support would make it unlikely that managers  would incur any obloquy 
were they to do initiate  the vote. The possibility  of obloquy would only arise 
if the vast majority of shareholders were against opting out.229 And if that 
were the case, there would be no reason for directors and executives to initiate the opt out process, as ther e would be no chance that it would be 
successful. 
3. Roughly Commensurate Costs to Investors 
An additional assumption of the reasoning in Section IV.A is that the 
costs and benefits to different in vestors from disclosure are roughly 
commensurate based on their pro rata holdings. This would not be the case 
if some investors had costs or benefits that were orders of magnitude greater 
(on a per-share basis) than  others. If so, even if a majority of  investors 
preferred to opt out of disclosure, the costs to the minority from such an opt-
out might be greater than the benefits  to the majority from opting out. Of 
course, for this to be the case, as th e minority got smaller,  the greater would 
have to be their per-share costs. However, while there might be some 
variation among investors in how mu ch they value disclosure, these 
amounts are unlikely to vary  by orders of magnitude . The main source of 
value for shareholders will be their future cash flow rights from share 
ownership, whether from the company or from the sale of their shares,

229 This would usefully prevent managers from over- initiating opt-outs. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  53 
 which will not vary among different investors (on a per-share basis). Some 
investors may have non-pec uniary preferences regard ing the actions of the 
company.230 It is difficult to compare the value of these preferences to 
pecuniary preferences, but to the extent it is possible, they are likely to be 
relatively small.231 Where an opt-out by the company does not match the 
preferences of a minority inve stor, that investor can se ll their shares, or shift 
to an investment manager that does not  invest in the company. The ability 
to do so would place an upper bound on the value of their non-pecuniary preferences.
232 For these reasons, it would be difficult to show that the 
preferences of minority inve stors against an opt-out were sufficiently strong 
to outweigh a majority preference in favor of an opt-out. 
4. Aggregate Costs of Opting Out Are Less Than the Benefits 
A final assumption of the reasoning in Section IV.A is that the cost to 
investors of the opt out process is rela tively small, compared to the benefit 
gained by those investors. The cost of the opt out process does not refer to the costs of preparing the disclosure its elf. Rather, it includes the costs to 
initiate the vote (described in Secti on IV.B.2), the cost to investors of 
deciding how to vote on the opt out proposal, and expenses that the 
company and investors may invest in tr ying to persuade other investors to 
vote in favor of or against the opt out.
233 If these opt out process costs were 
substantial, and the benefits that resu lted from opting out were small, or if 
opt out votes failed, resulting in no be nefit to investors, the costs for a 
particular company of making an opt-out decision could outweigh the 
 
230 For the general point that investors may have non-pecuniary preferences, see  Oliver 
Hart & Luigi Zingales, Companies Should Maximize Shareholder Welfare Not Market 
Value , J.L.  FIN. & ACCT. 247 (2017); Hirst, supra  note 223. For an attempt to determine 
the extent of these preferences, see generally Scott Hirst, Kobi Kastiel, & Tamar Kricheli-
Katz, How Much Do Investors Care About Social Responsibility? (June 2, 2022) 
(unpublished manuscript) (available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=4115854) . 
231 See generally  Hirst, Kastiel & Kricheli-Katz, supra  note 230 (conducting an 
experiment to estimate the amounts that investor s are willing to forgo for social interests).  
232 If sufficient minority investors cared enough about disclosure, they could also “buy” 
votes to try and block the opt-out decision, by borrowing shares prior to the record date of the meeting. For a discussion of practical challenges to this approach, see generally Scott Hirst & Adriana Robertson, Hidden Agendas in Shareholder Voting , 39 Y
ALE J. REGUL .

233 It is likely that managers would be better informed about the costs to the company of 
complying with the disclosure requirements than investors, and would need to 
communicate these to investors to allow investors to vote in a way that is privately optimal 
for them. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  54 
benefits of the opt out itself. If suffic ient companies had opt out costs that 
were greater than the benefits of the opt out, the net cost to those companies 
from the opt out process could outweigh the other benefits of an investor-
optional rule. 
However, four factors associated with the nature of opt out voting 
decisions, and of the investors that w ould determine the outcome of opt out 
votes at the great majority of compan ies means that the costs of opting out 
are likely to be relatively small, and thus this assumption is likely to be 
reasonable. First, companies already s ubmit multiple matters to votes each 
year, and investors that hold portfolios of many co mpanies already vote on 
hundreds, or thousands, of matters each  year. Companies and investors have 
well-developed processes in place for these votes, designed to reduce their 
cost.234 The marginal costs to the company of adding a single additional 
vote, or to investors of considering a single additional vot e, are unlikely to 
be significant.235 An opt-out vote would be comp arable to the marginal cost 
of a single shareholder proposal, many of which are included in company proxy statements each year under the SE C’s Rule 14a-8. To argue that the 
costs associated with putting forward and voting on a single opt out proposal 
are substantial would run counter to th e continued existence of Rule 14a-8. 
Second, the nature of institutional investors, whose votes are likely to 
be determinative in these matters,  means that extensive information 
campaigns by managers (or other investors) to convince them how to vote are unlikely to be necessary, or even e ffective. The largest of these investors 
submitted comments on the Proposed Ru le, and thus likely already have 
well-informed views on the likely effects of the disclosure requirements on their portfolio companies generally.
236 The informational demands of these 
investors could be satisfied by the company’s statement in its proxy 
statement supporting the opt out pr oposal, in which managers would 
articulate the costs of the disclo sure to the company. Because these 
 
234 For companies these include processes for the discussion of matters with advisors, 
the approval of matters by the board, and th e drafting and inclusion of the matter in proxy 
statements. For investors these include getting advice on the proposal from proxy advisors 
and using advisors to vote their shares.  
235 For the great majority of investors that hold significant portfolios, their voting 
decisions will be informed by similar decisions at other companies that have faced similar opt-out decisions, reducing the marginal cost of each opt-out decision. 
236 See, e.g. , BlackRock, Inc., supra note 57, at 1; State Street Global Advisors, supra 
note 57, at 1; Fidelity Investments, supra note 57, at 1; Vanguard Group, Inc., supra  note 
57, at 1; Capital Research & Management Co., supra note 57, at 1. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  55 
 investors are broadly diversified, and because opt out decisions will be very 
similar in comparable companies, the investors can incorporate information 
from opt out votes that they have cast  in at comparable companies in the 
past into their decisions. 
Third, these investors are likely to ta ke the costs of the opt out process 
into account. An investor that was focused only on a particular opt out vote 
at a particular company would rationally di sregard the costs of the opt out 
process in deciding how to vote, beca use those process co sts would be “sunk 
costs” from the frame of the opt ou t decision—they would be incurred 
regardless of the decision, and prior to the decision being made. However, 
the broadly diversified nature of thes e investors means they will likely also 
consider the effects of their opt out decision on other companies in their 
portfolio.237 These investors would rationally also take into account costs 
imposed on investors by th e opt out process itself , and whether they are 
likely to be greater than the benefits of opting out itself. If this were the 
case, the investors could decide to vote against th e opt out. Institutional 
investors might also use other meas ures to discourage managers from 
initiating net-costly opt out processes, or from excessive spending of 
company resources on information campaigns related to the opt out vote.238 
Finally, the SEC has the power to design the opt out method so as to 
reduce the cost as much as possible.  Part V considers some features 
designed to reduce the cost of opting out.239 
*  *  * 
 
237 That diversified investors would consider the effects of their votes on other companies 
in their portfolio is consistent with recent work focused on portfolio-level thinking with 
respect to stewardship decisions. For discussions of this portfolio-level approach, see  
Madison Condon, Externalities and the Common Owner , 95 W ASH. L. REV. 1 (2020); 
Jeffrey N. Gordon, Systematic Stewardship , 47 J.  CORP. L. 627 (2022); Tallarita, supra 
note 1. 
238 For instance, institutional investors could adopt policies indicating that they would 
sanction directors that approve costly opt-out decisions, or spend excessively on them, by 
withholding votes from those directors at the subsequent annual meeting. For an analysis of the use of such “withhold campaigns” to sanction managers for other matters, see 
generally Yonca Ertimur, Fabriz io Ferri, & David Oesch, Understanding Uncontested 
Director Elections , 64 M
GMT. SCI. 3400 (2018). 
239 For instance, if opt-out decisions lasted for, say, five years, opting out would require 
only one vote every five years. For a discussion of such features of the opt-out process, see 
infra Section V.C. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  56 
The realities of manager and investor  behavior, and the opt out process, 
mean that these assumptions are likely to be reasonable, and certainly not 
so unreasonable that they could inva lidate the base case that investor-
ordering would be better for investor s in companies disclosing climate 
information than a mandatory rule. 
C. Externalities for Investors in Other  Companies? 
The analysis so far has focused on th e costs and benefits  to investors in 
a particular company from that particular company disclosing its climate 
emissions. I turn now to consider how externality benefits could possibly  
alter the conclusion reached above, that  investor-optional disclosure would 
be better for investors than a mandatory rule.240 This Section explains why 
the existence of substantial externality benefits to other investors would be 
critical to the SEC’s justification for a mandatory disclosure rule. It also 
explains the significant challenges with  establishing substantial externality 
benefits, and why investors in co mpanies considering opting out of 
disclosure are instead likely to interna lize most of the benefits to investors 
outside the company in making their decision whether to opt out. As a result, 
any remaining externality benefits to investors outside the company are 
likely to be relatively limited. 
If the SEC is to continue with a mand atory disclosure rule, the existence 
of sufficient externality benefits is critical—the y are the only logical and 
consistent way to justify the choice of  a mandatory rule over an investor-
optional rule. For that to be the cas e, climate disclosure by one company 
must create externality benefits for investors in other companies .241 
Investors in the potentially-disclosin g company would also have to choose 
to opt out; if they did not, there woul d be no difference be tween a mandatory 
rule and the investor-optional rule. But rational investors will only choose 
to opt out if they consider the costs to themselves of disclosing all or part of 
the required information are greater than  benefits (to such investors) of 
disclosure. For mandatory di sclosure to be better, the cost savings to the 
investors in the company from opting out must be less than the benefits that 
 
240 In this Section I focus on the potential positive externalities to investors in other 
companies from disclosure. Bu t the mere decision of a company whether to opt out will 
also have effects on other companies that could also be described as externalities—for 
example, for each company that decides not to  opt out, the cost to other companies of 
opting out may be higher. I discuss this particular issue in Section VI.A. 
241 For an extensive discussion of one such externality—more accurate  market pricing of 
climate risks—see generally Condon, supra  note 54. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  57 
 investors outside the co mpany would have received from the disclosure. 
And, aggregated across all companies, the difference must be greater than 
any other benefits that w ould accrue from investor optionality, including the 
reduction in the likelihood of invalidity. This Section considers the factors 
necessary for these condi tions to be satisfied. 
It is important to note that, to  justify a mandatory SEC rule, the 
externality benefits must be to other investors, not to other members of the 
public in general. As discussed in Pa rt II, the SEC could have based its 
rulemaking on a public intere st rational. Because it  did not, and focused 
entirely on investor protection and investor demand, it cannot rely on 
benefits to non-investors to justify the choice of a mandatory rule. I 
therefore limit my analysis to potential externality benefits to externality 
benefits to other investors.242 
If the SEC is to successfully justify a choice of a manda tory rule over 
an investor-optional alternative, it must be specific about exactly which 
investors outside the disclosing company  would benefit from such 
disclosure, to what extent, and why the disclosing company would not 
internalize those benefits. The SEC focused on “making voting and 
investment decisions” as the reas on why investors demanded climate 
disclosure.243 Of these two purposes, externality benefits can apply only to 
investment decisions, as voting decisi ons are not relevant for investors 
outside the company (who have no right to vote on company matters).244 
Which investors outside the company might benefit from the company’s climate disclosure for investment pur poses? The two most plausible groups 
are potential  investors considering buying a stake in the company, and 
 
242 If the SEC were to consider the interests of the public at large, it would require a very 
challenging comparison of the benefits to no n-investors from disclosure, to the costs to 
investors from the disclosure, which would further complicate (and threaten) the SEC’s 
cost-benefit analysis. 
243 Proposed Rule, supra note 2, at 21335 (“We are proposing to require disclosures 
about climate-related risks and metrics reflec ting those risks because this information can 
have an impact on public companies’ financial performance or position and may be 
material to investors in making investment or voting decisions.”). 
244 It is suggestive of the fact that the SEC likely considers this to be the most important 
purpose of climate disclosure for investors th at the SEC presents evidence from a survey 
of institutional investors, making clear that a large majority of them focus on climate 
change as part of their stewardshi p of their assets in companies. See id.  at 21425 (discussing 
the 2021 Institutional Investors Survey). In addition, the SEC’s references to both 
BlackRock and SSGA relate to the importan ce of climate risk to their stewardship 
activities. See id. at 21425 (discussing climate change as the focus of the asset stewardship 
programs of BlackRock and SSGA in 2022).  November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  58 
investors (or potential investors) in other companies seeking an additional 
point of comparison for their own company.245 
An important point to recognize in analyzing these groups is that the 
great majority of investors in a company considering opting out of 
disclosure will internalize the comparis on benefits to investors in other 
companies, because they are the same investors . Most investors hold 
broadly diversified portfolios. This is  especially the case for institutional 
investors, that are required by la w to maintain a broad level of 
diversification. Index inve stors hold all companies in the index. And even 
most non-index investors have portfolio s that have a brea dth of coverage 
close to that of an index.246 
These investors are likely to deci de how to vote on the particular 
company’s opt out decision based on th e aggregate effects of the choice on 
all the companies in their portfolios, ra ther than merely the effects on the 
particular company.247 This will therefore include in their calculus benefits 
that they receive as investors in other companies, from the particular 
company’s disclosure, which will reduce the extent to which they allow the 
company to opt out.248 This is a version of argum ents that have been made 
about the impact of diversified po rtfolios on stewardship decisions by 
institutional investors.249 The fact that the SEC relies on demand from 
institutional investors to support the case for climate disclosure, and cites 
their very substantial hold ings, means that it is al so likely to recognize the 
internalization of comparabilit y benefits by such investors.250 The only 
situation where these investors are unlikely to be dominant is for very small

and potential investors) to have access to  climate-related investors, see Condon, supra note 
54, at 66–76.

similar to those of index investors, see K. J. Martijn Cremers & Antti Petajisto, How Active

supra  note 237; Gordon, supra note 237; Tallarita, supra note 1. 
248 For the sake of explanatory simplicity this Section ignores fractional interests. In 
reality, an investor that has a small interest in  the company but a substantial interest in other 
companies might have more benefit from the disclosure than cost. 
249 See Condon, supra note 237; Gordon, supra note 237; Tallarita, supra note 1.

disclosure, see Proposed Rule, supra note 2, at 21340–41.  November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  59 
 companies that are outside traditional indexes, and that therefore have a 
smaller proportion of their capital held by institutional investors.251 
There will be some investors outside the company that may have very 
different characteristics from the broadly diversified investors within the 
company. This is most obviously th e case with respect to socially 
responsible investors.252 However, even though the to tal capital invested in 
these funds has been growing in recent years, they still represent a very 
small fraction of U.S. e quity capital, less than two percent in June 2022.253 
For a company that does not meet the inve stment criteria of such funds, such 
as one with substantial carbon emissi ons, the investors in the company are 
likely to be ones with less of a “green” focus than those that choose not to 
invest in the company. Socially resp onsible investors outside the company 
may have greater demands for climate disclosure than those inside the 
company. However, the critical ques tion is the aggregate value of the 
climate disclosure to the investors out side the company. If the disclosure 
would not change the investment decisi on of those investors, it may not be 
particularly valuable to them. 
Even to the extent that there are co mpanies with a majority of investors 
that are not diversified, and therefore differ substantiall y from those outside 
the company, there are various market mechanisms that are likely to cause investors in the company to internalize benefits to potential investors 
outside the company.
254 One of the benefits of disclosure promoted by the 
SEC is that—by reducing uncertainty a bout a company’s climate risks—it 
would reduce a company’s cost of capital.255 It could also  increase the

equity capital). 
254 Additional groups of investors that is likely to be different from those outside the 
company (and undiversified), are directors, executives, and controlling shareholders. For a 
discussion of one important group of controlling shareholders—those with dual-class stock—see infra Section V.A. 
255 See, e.g. , Proposed Rule, supra note 2, at 21413 (discussing the benefit to investors 
of lowering the costs of capital of disclosing companies). November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  60 
number of investors willing to buy shares in the company, and thus the 
liquidity of existing investors.256 It is also possible that if the great majority 
of companies did not opt out, opting out would be seen as a substantial 
negative signal, that would impose si gnificant costs on  investors in a 
company. These costs would be factored  in by investor s in the company, 
reducing the extent of unintern alized externality benefits. 
Even assuming that there were substantial externality benefits to some 
investors outside the company that are not internalized by investors inside 
the company, a difficult question arises in comparing those benefits to the 
costs borne by the investors in the co mpany. The fact that  investors in a 
company choose to opt out of certain disclosure re quirements is concrete 
evidence that they consider the costs of disclosure to be greater than the 
benefits. On the other hand, it will ofte n be difficult to put a value on the 
benefit to a particular in vestor outside the company of disclosure of that 
company’s carbon risks and related information.257 The uncertainty of the 
amount of benefit to outside investors (a nd whether this is greater than costs 
to inside investors) would make it part icularly hard for the SEC to use this 
information to justify a mandatory ru le for the same reasons discussed 
regarding concrete costs and specula tive benefits in Section III.D. 
D. The Informational Benefits  of Investor optionality 
Investor optionality would also ove rcome a significant problem with 
mandatory rules—the lack of informati on that they provid e, and thus the 
difficulty of evaluating their effect s. Investor optionality would have 
considerable informational advantages over a mandatory rule. It would thus 
also provide indirect benefits to in vestors, by allowing to SEC to better 
evaluate the costs and benefits of climate disclosure and adjust its rules accordingly.
258 Because of the possibility of opting out, the benefits to 
investors from investor optionality are also le ss contingent on the SEC 
adjusting its rules. 
 
256 See, e.g. , id. (discussing the benefit to investors of lowering improving stock 
liquidity). 
257 One relevant metric might be the outs ide investor’s willingness to pay for that 
information. Of course, if the information is unlikely to change the investor’s decision then 
the investor might not be willing to pay very much for it. 
258 In making this argument, this Article follo ws an earlier recognition and discussion of 
the benefits to agencies from adopting an “options approach” to rulemaking by Alex Lee. 
See generally Lee, supra  note 68.  November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  61 
 Part of the informational benefit from investor optionality would come 
from the fact that it would provide probative evidence in particular 
companies that investors demand such  disclosure. Because directors and 
managers can be expected to initiate  opt-outs if investors are likely to 
support them, and because investors would opt out of parts of the rule that 
they do not support for a pa rticular company, the ab sence of such an opt-
out would provide probative evidence th at investors in a particular company 
demanded that information.259 A mandatory rule would provide no such 
information, and rests on the SEC’s controvertible belief that investors in 
that company are likely to demand that  information. The benefits of this 
specific information about investor de mand for defending the validity of the 
Proposed Rule have already been discussed.260 
An investor-optional rule would also provide considerably more 
information to the SEC regarding its value and effectiveness than would a 
mandatory climate disclosure rule.261 The only method for issuers and 
investors to modify a mandatory disclo sure rule is to lobby the SEC for an 
amendment.262 Such lobbying provides some in formation to the SEC, but it 
suffers from significant deficiencies. Not all relevant pa rties are equally 
motivated to spend their limited resources informing the SEC of 
shortcomings in its rules, or rebuttin g claims by others of shortcomings.263 
Some parties may have incentives to misstate or exaggerate the costs or 
benefits of parts of the Proposed Rule. The best source of information for 
the SEC would thus be its own efforts to analyze the rule, as part of a 
structured retrospective analysis of the Proposed Rule. But such a process 
occurs infrequently, and when it does, is likely to consume considerable 
SEC resources.264 
In contrast, investor-optional climat e disclosure would provide a metric 
for the value and e ffectiveness of the Proposed Rule that is granular, 
automatic, observable, timely, and incontrovertible.265 This information 
would be apparent simply from the beha vior of issuers in choosing to opt 
 
259 For other implications of this inference, see  also supra Section II.A and Section II.B.

263 See id.  
264 See id.  at 274. 
265 Id. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  62 
out of some or all of the requi rements of the Proposed Rule.266 Observing 
the proportion of issuers that opted out of that part of the Proposed Rule 
would allow the SEC—and others—to read ily ascertain the extent to which 
issuers and investors believed that certain parts of the Proposed Rule 
imposed excessive costs (or provide d insufficient benefits). This 
information would be useful for th e SEC in deciding whether to amend 
certain parts of the Proposed Rule.267 It would also be  useful for other 
issuers and investors considering whet her their company should opt out of 
some part of the Rule. 
Designing a rule as investor-optio nal would not obviate the need for 
retrospective analysis of the rule, but the information it provided would 
make it easier.268 This information would co me from two places. Most 
obviously, as discussed above, the SEC would have a ready yardstick for 
which parts of the Proposed Rule re quired amendment from the number of 
companies opting out of the rule. Bu t more importantly, variations in 
disclosure practices am ong the companie s that were bound by the Proposed 
Rule and those that had opted out would give the SEC a much stronger basis 
to analyze the actual eff ects of the Proposed Rule  than with mandatory 
climate disclosure. This is because mandatory climate disclosure applies uniformly to all corporations, at the same time. As a result, there is no 
variation among corporations, or across tim e, that could be associated with 
changes in outcomes.
269 And the lack of any companies that are not bound 
by the rule means that there is no count erfactual control gr oup against which 
the “treatment” effect of the rule can be compared.270 
Investor optionality would also make  the benefits of the Proposed Rule 
to investors less dependent on the SEC amending the rule after such 
 
266 A potential counter-argument is that, if companies fail to opt out even when it would 
be beneficial for them to do so (for instance, because investors impose excessive 
reputational penalties on companies that opt out), then the limited number of opt-outs may 
make it harder for the SEC to eliminate the climate disclosure rule even though it may be 
better for investors to do so. However, such a situation could also be interpreted as the SEC taking into account the wishes of invest ors (expressed through the same reputational 
penalties) to maintain climate disclosure, and thus acting optimally. 
267 This point is an instantiation of a more generalized argument made by Alex Lee, that 
optionality in rulemaking would be valuable for agencies because it would allow agencies 
to adjust their rules using information revealed by the exercise of those options. See Lee, 
supra  note 68, at 929.  
268 See Hirst, supra  note 34, at 274–75. 
269 See id.  at 271. 
270 See id.  November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  63 
 retrospective analysis, because investors could opt out of the rule. SEC 
regulation could impose costs on investors to the extent that its requirements 
differ from what investors need at a particular point in time, because of 
delays in the modification of SEC regulat ions. Of course, if all parts of the 
mandatory Proposed Rule are always bene ficial for all issuers, there is no 
need for any modification of the Rule after it is implemented. But even 
assuming that the Proposed Rule is  perfectly designed when it is 
implemented, circumstances may change in the future that make some parts of it no longer optimal for all companie s. And there is some likelihood that 
some disclosure obligations in the Proposed Rule, while well intentioned, may actually prove not to be beneficial  for the investors of all companies.
271 
In the likely event that one or both of these are the case, investor welfare would only be improved by subsequent amendments to the Proposed Rule 
to overcome its recognized deficiencies. Because of the delay that is likely to occur before the SEC amends its rules,  the costs to investors in the interim 
may be substantial.
272 
In contrast, an investor-optional rule  that was net-costly for investors 
would effectively be self-re pealing. If investors in an  issuer believed that a 
particular requirement was costly, they  could simply authorize the company 
to opt out of that part of the Proposed  Rule. This would el iminate or greatly 
reduce those costs that we re incurred by investors before any amendment 
were made to the rule. It would also have significant benefits for the SEC rulemaking process, including allowing the SEC to focus its limited 
resources on other matters, further e nhancing investor welfare. I discuss 
these benefits further in Part VI.C. 
V. D
ESIGNING INVESTOR OPTIONALITY  
Making climate disclosure investor -optional would immediately shift 
much of the focus of the rulemaki ng from the questions of whether to 
 
271 For an example of an argument that clim ate disclosure requirements should vary by 
industry, see Sarah Grey et al., ESG Climate Disclosures: Is One Size Fits All Best? ,

blogs/environmental-edge/2022/01/esg-climate-disclosures. 
272 The challenges of amending existing rule s, together with the SEC’s institutional 
constraints, means that it often does not amend its rules to overcome perceived deficiencies, 
and even if it does, it rarely acts quickly to do so. For a discussion of the limited number 
and efficacy of retrospective analyses, see Randall Lutter, Regulatory Policy: What Role 
for Retrospective Analysis and Review? , 4 J.  BENEFIT -COST ANALYSIS  17 (2013). November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  64 
regulate climate disclosure and the conten t of that disclosure, to the process 
and conditions requir ed for opting out of the di sclosure obligations. This 
Part therefore discusses the details of how the SEC should structure the opt 
out arrangements of an investor-optional rule.273 
The details of the opt out  process are critical to the success of an 
investor-optional rule.274 Two of these features, described in V.A and V.B, 
impose crucial guardrails on the opt out  process, without which there is a 
possibility that an investor-optional ru le could be worse fo r investors than a 
mandatory rule. If these were not in cluded, it is possibl e that companies 
could opt out of disclosure obligations  even against the preferences of a 
majority of those companies’ equity capital holders after they go public. If 
sufficient companies opted out against su ch preferences, and/or if the costs 
to investors of those opt -outs were high enough, the aggregate cost of those 
opt-outs could outweigh the other benefi ts of investor optionality, making 
it worse for investors  than a mandatory rule. This Part also considers several 
additional features that it would be desirable for the SEC to include, to 
enhance the investor protection. 
A. Approval of a Majority of Equity Capital 
A critical requirement for investor optionality is that opt-outs be 
approved by investors. In order to ensu re that investor optionality is better 
for investors than a mand atory rule, the approval s hould be by holders of a 
majority of equity capital voting at a meeting of shareholders, rather than 
simply by a majority of votes cast.275 In companies with a single class of 
shares, these two standards would be the same. But in companies where 
controlling shareholders have more vot es per share than other investors, 
these enhanced voting rights would a llow controlling shareholders to 
 
273 This Section focuses on the design of the climate disclosure rule, rather than the 
process by which the SEC would adopt a rule that included the design elements discussed 
here, such as whether the SEC would or woul d not need to allow additional comments on 
the opt-out design. 
274 For a discussion of the importance of the details of private ordering arrangements, see 
Bebchuk & Hirst, supra  note 73, at 347–48. 
275 A possible variation could be for the opt-ou t to require the votes of a majority of 
equity capital of the company outstanding . Requiring a percentage of equity capital 
outstanding would impose higher threshold, analogous to the requirement to amend the 
charter of the company, and would further protect investors, by requiring greater turnout by investors in order to approve the opt-out. For a discussion of issues with investor turnout 
for charter amendments, see generally Scott Hirst, Frozen Charters , 34 Y
ALE J. REGUL . 91 
(2017). November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  65 
 approve opt-outs even when the holders of a majority of the equity capital 
of the companies were against such opt- outs. If this is the case, such opt-
outs could impose significant costs on th e holders of the majority of the 
equity capital in these companies.  Requiring approval by shareholders 
holding securities that constitute a ma jority of the equity capital of the 
company would protect other investor s against such opt-outs. Because 
controlling shareholders are likely to be less diversified than other investors, 
they may also be less likely to inte rnalize any externality benefits from 
disclosure that accrue to i nvestors outside the company.276 Functionally, 
this feature of an op-out rule would disregard for the purposes of the opt out 
approval higher voting rights that certa in shareholders might have for 
elections under state law.277  
B. Approval of Investors After Going Public 
A second way that a poorly designe d opt out mechanism would allow 
an investor-optional mechanism to be worse for investors  than a mandatory 
rule is if a company is able to opt out before the co mpany goes public. If 
that is the case, the opt out decision will be controlled by a different and 
much smaller group of inve stors than those that wi ll form the shareholder 
base of the company after the compa ny’s initial public offering (“IPO”).278 
As a result, even if the post-IPO investors would benefit from climate 
disclosure, they could be deprived of it by a pre-IPO opt out. 
The impact of this feature will vary between disclosure under the 
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934. Disclosure 
under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, in annual reports on Form 
 
276 Imposing this constraint would effectiv ely prevent shareholders that control 
companies through the use of dual-class stock from using their voting power to opt out of 
climate disclosure. This is an unfamiliar limitati on from the point of vi ew of corporate law, 
which places relatively few limits on the ability of such investors to control companies. 
For these investors, this version of investor optionality would be no worse than a mandatory 
rule, which would also deprive them of the ability to opt out, and possibly better, to the extent that they can use their pro rata share of votes in conjunction with the votes of other 
investors to opt out. 
277 If the SEC were concerned about the abuse of minority shareholders by controlling 
shareholders that own a majority of company stock, the SEC could impose further constraints on opt-outs, such as requiring a ma jority-of-the-minority vote in order to opt 
out. However, I do not propose such a constraint here, as it would effectively disenfranchise 
the largest shareholders of those companies.  
278 This would also apply to companies that go public through a direct listing, though for 
simplicity of exposition this Section only refers to those that go public through an IPO. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  66 
10-K, are post-IPO by definition.279 Implementing a pos t-IPO opt out for 
these disclosures would be straightfo rward—the opt out could simply be 
conditioned on an appropriate vote after the company had gone public. 
However, this solution would not f unction for disclosure obligations 
under the Securities Act of 1933, which are included in registration 
statements drafted before a company going public.280 Since these are 
prepared and filed pre-IPO, there are no public shareholders to vote to opt 
out. This effectively requires the SEC to decide between a mandatory rule 
for disclosure in registration statemen ts, or allowing companies to opt out 
based on the vote of a different set of investors than will benefit from the disclosure. Even if the SEC chose the la tter option, it is not clear that this 
would substantially reduce protection for post-IPO investors, since the 
company would still be obligated to e ither disclose the information at the 
end of its fiscal year in which it goes public, or to opt out through a vote of the post-IPO shareholders that would benefit from the disclosure.
281 
C. Sunsetting Approval Requirements 
A third (but much less likely) way in which an invest or-optional rule 
could be worse than a mandatory rule is if investors that had supported an 
opt-out later change their prefer ences in such a way that they do prefer to 
receive disclosure regarding climate emis sions. If the cost to those investors 
from missing out on disclosure that w ould otherwise have been obligated is 
greater than the cost savings from i nvestors choosing to opt out, then the 
investor-optional rule could be worse  than a mandatory rule. 
To avoid this proble m, the SEC should impose a “sunset” on the 
effectiveness of opt out decisions.282 This could be done by allowing 
companies to opt out where there had been an investor vote (of the kind 
 
279 See 17 C.F.R. § 249.310 (2021) (requiring disclosure on Form 10-K). 
280 See 17 C.F.R. § 239.11 (2021) (requiring disclosure on Form S-1). 
281 One benefit of allowing companies to opt out of registration statement disclosure 
before going public is that it may reduce the cost of preparing a registration statement, 
thereby improving capital formation. This would also be consistent with the rationale of 
requiring less disclosure for emerging growth companies. See 15 U.S.C. § 77b(19) 
(defining “emerging growth companies”). 
282 Alex Lee has previously argued for a sunset approach to creating optionality in SEC 
rulemaking. See Lee, supra note 68, at 909 . Sunsets have also been proposed for corporate 
law rules, such as dual-class provisions. See, e.g. , Lucian A. Bebchuk & Kobi Kastiel, The 
Untenable Case for Perpetual Dual-Class Stock , 103 V A. L. REV. 585, 617–26 (2017)  
(discussing arguments for dual-class sunsets, and potential objections). November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  67 
 described above) within the last five years (or some similar period).283 For 
the company to continue to opt out af ter that period, managers would thus 
have to resubmit the opt out to a vote of investors at least every five years. 
This would allow investors to determine whether they wished to continue 
the opt out or not, there by taking into account any changes in investor 
preferences.284 
This sunset requirement is similar to the requirement that a company 
hold a say-on-pay vote at least once every three years,285 and a vote on the 
frequency of say-on-pay votes at least once every six years.286 Functionally, 
it would have a similar e ffect to sunsetting the exemptions from certain 
disclosure obligations for emerging growth companies af ter five years, 
except in this case, the exemption could be renewed.287 Similar sunset 
arrangements have also been prop osed for other corporate governance 
arrangements.288 
D. Opting Out by Disclosure of a Vote 
One potential vector of attack agai nst an investor-optional climate 
disclosure rule is the argument that, by making disclosure contingent on an investor vote, it strays into territory that has traditionally been the realm of 
state law. In Santa Fe Industries, Inc. v. Green , the Supreme Court refused 
to allow a cause of action under Rule 10b-5 for breach of fiduciary duties, 
in part because “that cause of action [is] one traditionally relegated to state 
 
283 Structuring the rule in this way would have the additional advantage of allowing 
companies to opt out of climate disclosure obligations before the rule had come into effect, 
so any public company whose investors supported opting-out could do so even before they became subject to the obligations, thereby avoiding any costs associated with the 
disclosure. 
284 An alternative solution would be to allow investors to opt back in, such as through a 
shareholder proposal. However, because of the collective action problems of investors, there would likely be under-initiation of opt-back-in votes, even where investors desired that they take place. The opt-back-in approach is therefore likely to be inferior to the sunset 
approach. 
285 See 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a-21(a) (2021). 
286 See 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a-21(b) (2021). 
287 See 15 U.S.C. § 77b(19)(B) (2021). 
288 See generally Bebchuk & Kastiel, supra note 271; Comm’r Robert J. Jackson, SEC,  
PERPETUAL DUAL-CLASS STOCK : THE CASE AGAINST CORPORATE ROYALTY  (Feb. 15, 
2018), https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/p erpetual-dual-class-stock-case-against-
corporate-royalty. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  68 
law”, suggesting that the party seeking the right of action could instead avail 
itself of remedies created under state law.289 
A close reading of that precedent sugg ests that mere consideration of a 
shareholder vote for purposes of determin ing if disclosure is required would 
not make the rule invalid. The SEC woul d not be creating a cause of action 
or a remedy, or doing some thing already done by st ate law. State law does 
not require disclosure of climate emissi ons, or create a way of opting out of 
federal disclosure requirements. And many well-accepted SEC rules 
already concern themselves with voting matters that have traditionally been 
the purview of state law.290  
Nonetheless, the SEC may wish to avoid entanglement with state law as 
much as possible. One way to do so would be to avoid any language requiring or obligating a vote, or any features of a vote. Instead, the SEC 
could condition the opt out on the registrant having disclosed a vote that 
meets certain conditions. Requiring disclosure of matters submitted to a 
vote of security holders, and details regarding thos e matters, is already an 
established and well-accepted part of the SEC’s disclosure requirements.
291 
Conditioning an opt-out on disclosure is also the appr oach taken by the 
SEC in its proposed rule regarding investment advisors to provide 
additional information a bout their ESG practices.292 The Proposed Rule 
requires investment advisers of “ESG-F ocused funds” to disclose aggregate 
GHG emissions.293 The advisor is not required to  make this disclosure for a 
fund “that affirmatively states in th e “ESG Strategy Overview” table . . . 
that it does not consider the green house gas (“GHG”) emissions of the 
portfolio in which it invests.”294 The SEC could use a similar structure to 
allow issuers to opt out of their emi ssions disclosure obligations, if they 
disclosed that a shareholder vote meeting the conditions described in this Part had taken place.

 E. Changes to Disclosure Rules Regarding Shareholder Votes 
If the SEC adopts a condition based on a disclosure of a vote of majority 
of equity capital as suggested in  Section V.A, it should also make 
conforming changes to its rules requiring disclosure of matters submitted to 
a vote of security holders to also requ ire disclosure of information relevant 
to opt out votes. Issuers are currently required to disclose matters related to 
votes of security holders under Item 5.07 of Rule 8-K.295 This includes the 
number of votes cast fo r and against a matter.296 For the same reasons 
described in Section V.A, it would also  be useful for investors to know the 
number of shares of equity capital th at voted for and ag ainst the proposal, 
and that abstained from voting. For co mpanies where each share of equity 
capital carries the same number of votes, this information is already 
required to be disclosed;297 the change would only affect disclosure by 
companies with unequal voting rights. 
Without disclosure of such information, investors in companies with 
unequal voting rights would be unaware whether an opt-out vote has passed 
or not, and how close it was to pa ssing. At a minimum, this disclosure 
should be applied to matters related to opting out from climate disclosure. However, requiring this disclosure for other matters that are voted on would 
also benefit investors,  by making clear when unaffiliated investors 
disagreed with controlling shareholders. 
F. Hedging Opt-Out Rules With an Opt-In Rule 
As well as allowing investors to opt out of climate disclosure, the SEC 
should consider also allowing investors to opt in  to climate disclosure. For 
the reasons discussed in Section I.B, an opt  in rule is likely to be inferior to 
an opt-out rule. However, the SEC could implement both rule designs 
disjunctively. That is, an i ssuer could be required to  disclose each of the 
matters set out in the Proposed Rule, either if the issuer had not opted out 
of the rule, as discusse d throughout this Article, or if there had been a vote 
of investors opting in to the rule (sub ject to the same conditions described 
in Section V.A-V.D). 
This would have two benefits. First,  it would allow a majority vote of 
investors to “opt back in” if they had previously voted to opt out of climate 
 
295 See 17 C.F.R. § 249.308, Item 5.07 (2021). 
296 See id. 
297 See 17 C.F.R. § 249.308, Item  5.07(b) (2021). November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  70 
disclosure but had changed their view s regarding the value of disclosure 
since that opt out. If so, the opt out could be structured as requiring the 
disclosure unless the company has disc losed a vote by investors authorizing 
an opt-out, and has not disclosed a vote opting back in.  
A second and much more important bene fit is that an opt in rule would 
hedge against the possibility that the opt  out rule is inva lidated by judicial 
review, by providing a backstop if that were  to occur. Such an opt in rule is 
more likely to survive judicial re view; given the unfettered choice of 
companies to adopt the rule, it is hard to conceive of a reason why an opt in 
disclosure rule would be invalidat ed. Certainly, none of the potential 
grounds for invalidation of a mandatory rule raised by opponents (and 
considered in Part III) would apply to an opt in rule. As a result, even a 
decision invalidating an opt-out rule is likely to leave an opt in component 
unaffected, thereby allowing it to remain as a backstop.298 
The core claim of this Article is that  an opt-out rule would be better for 
investors than a mandatory rule. Su ggesting an opt in backstop does not 
derogate from that claim. Instead, the reasoning for a backstop opt in rule is that it would be better for investors than  no rule at all. This is because it 
would provide an easy m echanism, and a focal point, for investors opting 
in to the rule if the opt out rule were invalidated.
299 Even though the 
likelihood of an investor-optional clima te disclosure being invalidated is 
substantially less than the likelihoo d that a mandatory rule would be 
invalidated, it is not zero—it is impo ssible to predict with certainty how a 
court will treat even an investor-opti onal rule. So despite the strong reasons 
why investor-optional rules should  be valid, it is possible that a court may 
nonetheless invalidate such a rule. If the SEC had no backstop opt in rule, the situation would return to the st atus quo. For companies where investors 
demand disclosure that managers do not provide, the investors must currently engage with directors, and/ or put forward a precatory shareholder 
proposal urging the adoption of climate  standards. Creating a simplified 
method for opting-in to th e rule would create a st andard arrangement for 
companies to opt in to. This would result in greater uniformity among 
 
298 If a mandatory rule (or an investor-optional rule) were to be invalidated, the SEC 
could, of course, always adopt an opt-in rule as a stopgap after the invalidation. But that is 
likely to take substantial time. Including an opt-in rule in the final rule as a backstop would avoid the lag time, and would therefore provide greater benefit to investors.

Schelling points, see T HOMAS C. SCHELLING , THE STRATEGY OF CONFLICT  (1960). November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  71 
 companies that had opted-in, and woul d also make it much easier for 
investors to opt in.300 
VI. THE IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS OF INVESTOR OPTIONALITY  
This Part considers the likely impact  of investor optionality on climate 
disclosure, and its implications beyond climate disclosure. Applying 
investor optionality to other SEC rules would also benefit investors; Section 
VI.B considers the potential for such an approach, and its  limits. Section 
VI.C then considers the benefits to the SEC  from adopting investor 
optionality more broadly. 
A. The Likely Impact of Investor-O ptional Climate Disclosure 
One of the main aims of this Article has been to lay out the analytical 
arguments why the SEC should make its Proposed Rule investor optional. 
However, weighing all of the relevant fa ctors is very challenging to do in 
the abstract, as it depends substantia lly on which companies would opt out, 
and which investors outside the comp any would have benefited from their 
disclosure. To analyze the likely impact of investor optiona lity, this Section 
anticipates the most likely outcome if an investor-optional rule climate rule 
is implemented, and compares those to what would be the case under a 
mandatory rule. Because of the challe nges of predicting opt out decisions, 
this Section limits itself to broad conclusions based on the characteristics and distribution of existing investors, such as which types  of companies may 
 
300 The problems that an opt-in arrangement would overcome are demonstrated by the 
adoption of proxy access arrangements by comp anies after the SEC’s failed proxy access 
rule. See also supra notes 92-97 and accompanying text. Indeed, these problems are likely 
to be considerably wo rse for climate disclosu re than they were for proxy access. Despite 
shareholder support for proxy access and pressure on managers to adopt it, managers did 
not always adopt the arrangements that shareholders requested or that they would have 
preferred. See, e.g., Holland et al., supra  note 95. For shareholders to implement a proxy 
access arrangement through a shar eholder proposal to amend a company’s bylaws was very 
difficult, because the detail required was difficult to condense the space constraints 
imposed by Rule 14a-8. See, e.g., Bebchuk & Hirst, supra  note 73. Where companies did 
adopt proxy access arrangements, there were  inevitable variations among companies, 
making it more difficult for investors to know what arrangements applied to a particular company, or to compare arra ngements across companies. See Holland et al., supra note 95. 
Proxy access did not involve considerable, detaile d disclosure; lack of  comparability across 
companies is likely to be a mu ch more acute problem for a di sclosure rule. Including an 
opt-in rule as a backstop for the situation wher e other parts of the rule are invalidated would 
avoid these problems by standardizing climate di sclosure for all companies that did opt-in.  November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  72 
or may not opt out of climate disclosu re, based on assumptions made by the 
SEC itself regarding the nature of in vestors demanding climate disclosure. 
One key assumption underpinning this analysis is the same as that made 
by the SEC in its reliance on investor demand: that a broad majority of 
institutional investors support most pa rts of the SEC’s climate disclosure 
rule.301 Institutional investors control subs tantial majorities of the capital of 
the great majority of U.S. public companies.302 This is overwhelmingly true 
among the largest companies, that make  up the bulk of the aggregate market 
capitalization of U.S. public companies.303 If the SEC’s assumptions are 
accurate, very few of these companies ar e likely to have an investor base 
that would support opting out of climate disclosure entirely. 
Comment letters submitted by a number of large institutional investors 
suggest that they did not support all of  the disclosure requirements in the 
SEC’s Proposed Rule. For example,  comment letters from BlackRock, 
SSGA, and Fidelity Investments a ll expressed opposition to required 
disclosure of Scope 3 emissions, and to  disclosure regarding disaggregated 
financial statements changes greater than a one-percent threshold.304 If a 
reasonable number of other large institutional investors share these views, it is likely that they would be wil ling to support opting out of those 
requirements. 
One possibility is that these invest ors might not vote in  favor of opting 
out, even though they believe opting out would reduce costs. This might be 
the case because it might be more salie nt for them to support an opt-out 
vote, rather than stick with the default.
305 My previous work has discussed 
the possibility of a backlash against in stitutional investors that exercise too 
much power.306 However, it is not clear whether this is likely to push

 powerful investment managers towards or against opting out.307 What is 
clear is that if it pushes them away  from opting out, there would be less 
difference between the situation unde r investor-optional disclosure and 
mandatory disclosure. 
Any prediction of the like ly levels of opt-outs must also consider the 
signaling effects of an opt-out decisi on. Given the conclusions above, that 
a limited number of companies will have  investors that will support opt out 
decisions, any opt-outs that are successful  are likely to be relatively salient 
to observers. If those investors are able  to draw a negative inference about 
the governance of the company from its opt out decision, then they could 
sell (or refuse to buy) shares of the company, increasing it s cost of capital.308 
If so, company managers would take in to account these potential costs when 
deciding whether to initia te an opt-out decision.309 It is difficult to predict 
the extent to which opt-out decisions will be attributable to poor 
performance, or whether investors will believe claim by managers that 
companies are opting out for reasons unr elated to governan ce quality, such 
as because of the high costs of disclosure. Probably, the signals drawn from opt-outs will vary among investors dr awing the signals. This suggests that 
at least some investors will draw a negative inference about the governance 
of a company from its opt out decision, and the comp any will suffer at least 
some reputational penalty from opting out . If this is the case, it will reduce 
the extent to which companies opt out of the Proposed Rule. This may result 
in fewer opt-outs than ar e optimal. But it would al so reduce the extent to 
which an opt-out rule resulted in substantially less disclosure than a 
mandatory rule. 
The set of companies whose ownership is least likely to be dominated 
by large institutional investors are micr ocap companies, those outside the

matters, see Dorothy S. Lund, Asset Managers as Regulators , 171 U. P A. L. REV. 
(forthcoming 2022) (manuscript at 11–16) (available at 
https://ssrn.com/abstract=3975847). 
308 That is, there would be a “separating equilibrium” in opt-out decisions, with lower-
quality companies opting out, and higher-quality companies not opting out. This differs from a “pooling equilibrium,” where the group  of companies opting out would include both 
lower-quality and higher-quality companies, making it impossible to accurately infer the 
level of quality from an opt-out decision. For the foundational discussion of separating and pooling equilibria, see George A. Akerlof, The Market for “Lemons”: Quality Uncertainty 
and the Market Mechanism , 84 Q.
 J. ECON. 488 (1970). 
309 See supra Section III.D. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  74 
Russell 3000.310 Because holdings of index funds are based on mainstream 
indexes like the S&P500 and the Russ ell 3000, those investment managers 
have smaller proportional holdings in companies that are not included those 
indexes, and other investors—which mi ght not derive as much benefit from 
climate disclosure—will have proportiona tely larger holdings. If the SEC’s 
views on investor demand are correct, these are the only group of companies 
for which high levels of opting out is even possible. But it is not clear 
whether this would occur.  If opting out does result in a negative signal that 
is costly for the company, these companie s will be less likely to opt out than 
they otherwise would be. It is also possible that because these companies are smaller, they may be more likely to internalize the benefits to other 
investors of climate disclo sure, such as through cost of capital, liquidity, or 
signaling.
311 Thus, if opting out were likely to impose costs on the company 
investors in these companies might be less willing to do so. 
Even if these companies did opt out, they constitute a very small 
proportion of the U.S. capital market.312 For the great majority of 
companies, there would be standardi zation and comparability of climate 
information. Even if there are external ity benefits from disclosure to other 
investors, the small size and number of these companies may limit the aggregate amount of those benefits that would be foregone by investor 
optionality. 
*  *  * 
The analysis above suggests that, unl ess the SEC’s analys is is radically 
different from that put forward in this Section, it will find it challenging to 
justify the choice of a mandatory rule  over an investor-optional rule. The 
SEC would need to show that the benefits of investor optionality were outweighed by the benefits to other investors from disclosure of the 
particular items for whic h institutional investors s upporting opt-outs, and of 
broader disclosure by microcap companies.

 B. Investor Optionality Beyond Climate Disclosure 
The clearest implication of  this Article is that the SEC should consider 
alternatives to mandatory rules, su ch as investor optionality, in its 
rulemaking. This Article has focu sed on the SEC’s proposed climate 
disclosure rule. But the possible applic ation of investor optionality extends 
beyond climate disclosure. Most obvious ly, the arguments made in this 
paper would apply, mutatis mutandis , to other rules the SEC is considering 
regarding disclosure of environmental, social, or governance (ESG) 
matters.313 But most of the arguments made in this Article why investor 
optionality would be better for investors potentially apply to any SEC rule 
imposed on companies for the benefit of investors. This Section considers 
the benefits and boundaries of investor opt ionality beyond climate 
disclosure. 
Drawing boundaries around the types of rules for which investor 
optionality would be beneficial is impor tant, because the flip side of the 
potential applicability of investor optionality to other potential rules is the 
possibility of a “slippery slope.” Th at is, one potential reason why the SEC 
might be cautious about making climat e disclosure investor-optional is a 
concern that investor optionality mi ght prompt calls to make future 
disclosure obligations i nvestor-optional, or ev en to change existing 
disclosure rules to be investor-optiona l. If the SEC is willing to relax its 
historical practice of on ly making mandatory rules, this could create a 
precedent whereby the SEC would face pre ssure to take a similar approach 
for other rules. The SEC may be concerned that adopting (or even 
countenancing) investor optionality  might therefore fundamentally 
undermine its mandatory disclosure regime. 
However, clear boundary principles  for rules for which investor 
optionality is likely to be beneficial  would substantially alleviate these 
concerns. As outlined in Parts II and III, the advantages of investor optionality over mandatory rules are likel y to be greatest where there is 
uncertainty about the benefi ts and costs to investor s from a rule, and where 
investor optionality has additional be nefits from reducing the likelihood of

agenda” outlining its expected upcoming activities—including rulemaking regarding 
human capital disclosure, and board diversity—see Cydney Posner, A Jam-Packed Spring 
2022 Agenda for the SEC , HARV. L. SCH. F. ON CORP. GOVERNANCE  (July 17, 2022),

invalidation. In addition, where the cost s of the opt out process are high, or 
where there are clear externality benefits to investors outside the particular 
company subject to the rule, investor  optionality may be worse than a 
mandatory rule. 
These boundary principles allow th e great majority of existing SEC 
disclosure rules to quickly be dismisse d from this slippe ry slope scenario. 
Neither of these advantages applies to long-established SEC disclosure 
obligations. There is little risk of vali dation of these rules. And for most of 
these, there is likely to be little demand from investors to opt out of the 
rules: the fact that companies alread y have systems to comply with those 
rules, and that investors have system s that utilize that information, means 
that the benefits for investors of retaining the rules are likely to outweigh 
the costs of complying with them. For in stance, it is very difficult to imagine 
the SEC facing pressure to weaken the obligation to provide audited 
financial statements. In effect, fo r these rules, there is actually a sticky 
slope .314 
There may be a small number of ex isting rules that are exceptions, 
where there may be investor demand to opt out of a rule. For a small number of existing rules, investors have raised concerns that the disclosure was not 
useful, or was excessively costly to  produce, or both. Such investor 
ambivalence has long applied to the SEC’ s conflict minerals rule, and to a 
lesser extent, to the disclosure of management attestations of internal 
control under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
315 As this 
Article has demonstrated, provided ther e were robust guardrails to protect 
investors, investor-optio nal disclosure of these rules is likely to be better for 
investors than the current mandatory  requirement for such disclosure. 
New rules that the SEC proposed in th e future are likely to benefit much 
more from investor optionality. This is  especially likely where there is real 
disagreement or uncertain ty about the likely benefi ts to investors from the 
rule, and where the rule is likely to face the kinds of challenges to its validity 
outlined in Part III. In some cases, this will be clear to the SEC even before it proposes a rule. But in many cases, it will only become cl ear that there is

 substantial disagreement or  uncertainty about the bene fits to investors after 
public comments are received pointing that  out. Either case  should result in 
the SEC considering an investor optionality alternative, either in its 
proposing release, or in after receivin g comment and before issuing its final 
rule.316 
Although this Article has focused on a disclosure rule, disclosure 
represents the hardest case for the a pplication of investor optionality, 
because disclosure requirements are th e most likely to have externality 
benefits for investors outside the company subject to the rule.317 Rules that 
do not have significant disclosure components thus present a clearer case 
for investor optionality.318 This would, for example, include rules relating 
to the composition of boards, such as diversity rules that the SEC is 
understood to be considering.319 But it would also include certain existing 
rules, such as those requiring the inclusion of shareholder proposals in company proxy statements.
320 
C. The Implications of Investor optionality for SEC Rulemaking 
Although the focus of this Article is on the benefit of investor 
optionality for investors, investor opti onality is also likely to have four 
major benefits for SEC rulemaking, wh ich will also redound to the benefit 
of investors.321 First, for similar reasons to those outlined in Section III, 
investor optionality would reduce the likelihood of SEC rules being 
invalidated. 
Second, investor optionality would re duce the cost of SEC rulemaking. 
For the same reasons outlined in Section III.D, the intensive cost-benefit analysis of SEC rules would be made much easier if they are investor-
optional. Because the cost from an inve stor-optional rule is capped at the 
cost of opting out, the economic  analysis of the cost of  a rule can be confined 
to determining the cost of opting out. Indeed, because the cost of opting out 
 
316 The same points made in Section III.E woul d threaten these rules with invalidity if 
the SEC did not consider investor optionality. 
317 For a discussion of these potential externalities, see  supra Section IV.C. 
318 This includes the SEC’s failed proxy-access rule. For a discussion of how that rule 
could have been better structured as an investor-optional rule, see Bebchuk & Hirst, supra  
note 73. 
319 See supra note 313 (describing the contents of the SEC’s “Reg-Flex” agenda). 
320 See 17 C.F.R. § 240.14a-8 (2022). 
321 The discussion of these implications is ba sed substantially on my earlier analysis in 
Hirst, supra  note 34, at 272. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  78 
is likely to be related to the opt out vo ting process, and not to the nature of 
the rule itself, the analysis of costs of each investor-optional rule would be 
very similar. Building on analyses of this question from previous 
rulemakings would reduce the burden of the SEC’s economic analysis, and 
would allow them to refine the analysis  further. And the fact that a similar 
analysis would apply to each rule mean s the risk of a court invalidating the 
rule for insufficient cost-benefit analysis would be much lower. 
Third, the lower cost of investor-op tional rules would reduce the cost of 
SEC rulemaking.322 No matter the position one  takes on SEC rulemaking, 
making rules investor-optional woul d thus be better than mandatory 
rules.323 For those that believe that the SEC should spend less on 
rulemaking, investor optionality would reduce the cost of making a fixed number of rules.
324 For those that prefer that the SEC expand its rulemaking, 
investor optionality would allow the SEC to do more rulemaking with the 
same fixed set of resources.325 
Fourth, investor optionality would allow the SEC to more easily 
experiment with potential rules. Prev ious work has argue d that regulators 
should undertake experiments to assess the effects of a potential regulation 
before adopting it.326 Those authors proposed th at the SEC treat some 
companies (ideally, chosen randomly) differently from similar companies, to assess the effects on those “treated” companies.
327 One obvious issue 
with this is that if the treatment is effective, it will either disadvantage the treated companies, or possibly, disa dvantage the untreated companies. 
Imposing costs on either group of compan ies would be, by its very nature, 
arbitrary and capricious, and subject to potential invalidation under the 
Administrative Procedure Act.
328 The SEC is also likely to face significant 
opposition from the investors and managers of the companies that are disadvantaged.

 Investor-optional rules would allo w heterogeneous treatment while 
avoiding these problems. The SEC could apply an investor-optional rule to 
a subset of companies. Allowing comp anies to opt out would provide the 
SEC with information about investors’ views about the rule.329 In addition, 
so long as some companies did not opt out, the SEC would have a means of 
comparing a “treated” group with a “c ontrol” group. Of course, the opting 
out will not be random, and therefore it will be impossible to separate the 
effects of opting out from the factor s that underlie the opt out decision.330 
This is a valid concern for academics l ooking to understand the effect of the 
rule in isolation.331 But it is not particularly relevant information for the 
SEC in assessing the costs of the rule: as the same types of companies that opt out during the pilot can be expected to opt out when the rule is 
implemented, it is unnecessary for the SE C to isolate the treatment effect 
from the selection effect. 
C
ONCLUSION  
As this Article has explained, to save climate disclosure from claims of 
invalidity, and to better protect in vestors, the SEC should let investors 
decide. Specifically, the SEC should allow an  issuer to opt ou t of all or part 
of the obligation to make the disclosu res required by the Proposed Rule, if 
its investors authorize the issuer to do so, in a manner which would provide 
appropriate guardrails to protect invest ors. This Article has described three 
critical advantages of investor-optional disclosure over a mandatory 
disclosure rule: First, it would actually be consistent with the SEC’s investor 
demand rationale for the Proposed Rule , and would be the only practical 
way to resolve the uncertainty regarding the level of investor demand. Second, it would circumvent the major ar guments against th e validity of the 
Proposed Rule, which apply (if at all) only to mandatory rules. And third, 
allowing companies to opt out of climate change disclosure if their investors 
approve would be better for investors in those companies, and given the 
limited likelihood of substant ial externality benefits  to investors outside 
those companies, is also likely to be better for investors overall. 
 
329 Allowing an opt-out for a selected subset  of companies might provide a means to run 
a pilot study of a rule, in order to measure its likely effects or likely responses, before 
expanding the application of the rule to all companies. 
330 See supra Section IV.D. See also  Hirst, supra  note 34, at 278. 
331 Id. November 2022 SAVING CLIMATE DISCLOSURE  80 
Although the focus of this Article has been the SEC’s climate disclosure 
rule, investor optionality has much broader implications. Most obviously, 
the SEC should consider alternative ru le designs as part of its future 
rulemaking. The reasoning in this Article  why investor optio nality is likely 
to be better for investors than a mandat ory rule would also clearly apply to 
other ESG disclosure rules that the SE C may be considering, but would also 
apply to other SEC rules applicable to  companies where there is substantial 
uncertainty regarding the benefits to investors from the ru le, or substantial 
heterogeneity in its effe cts. By making these rules investor-optional, the 
SEC would improve its own regulatory pr ogram, as well as better protecting 
investors. "

I recently participated in a video discussion where Chairman Gensler emphasize the need for the rules to be defensible in court and have provided these comments with a focus on defensible rules. My background includes approximately 20 years’ experience as a senior executive focused on climate change solutions, including developing the concept for, leading the IPO and serving as the CFO of a climate solutions public company. I have engaged with hundreds of investors while raising, and overseen the investment, of several billion dollars in climate solutions. I also serve as an advisor to several climate focused companies. I have extensive hands-on knowledge of climate change, renewable energy and energy efficiency, TCFD implementation, and carbon accounting and carbon credits, as well as public reporting requirements both from the CFO and an investor viewpoint.  My experience has shown that addressing climate change is a journey with companies and investors at various stages along the path and with a high likelihood that along the way, there will be missteps and course corrections.  For example, a recent Bloomberg article describes in detail that the present scope 2 rules and the certain renewable energy credits allow companies to report reduced carbon emissions without measuring if their emissions have actually been reduced.1 Similarly, WattTime, a subsidiary of the Rocky Mountain Institute, recently released a white paper calling for refocusing the “Scope 2 methodology in ways that could guide institutions towards higher-impact choices and investments.”2 As a result of these and other comments, the World Resources Institute who developed the scope methodology and its partners are now reevaluating the decision and have started a review of the standard with a particular focus on how electricity emissions are measured. But any changes aren’t expected for at least two years.3 Given the early stage of climate solutions, I believe it is appropriate to encourage disclosure in a way that engages companies to focus on the ultimate goal of reducing carbon and adapting to climate change while not penalizing them for where they are in the journey or for likely course corrections. Accordingly, I offer four recommendations:  1 “What Really Happens When Emissions Vanish”, Ben Elgin and Sinduja Rangarajan, Bloomberg.com, October 31, 2002.  Available at https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-11-01/intel-p-g-cisco-among-major-companies-exaggerating-climate-progress?sref=sK8JGy19 2 “Accounting for Impact, Refocusing GHG Protocol Scope 2 methodology on ‘impact accounting”, Watt Time, September 2022.  Available at https://www.watttime.org/app/uploads/2022/09/WattTime-AccountingForImpact-202209-vFinal2.pdf. 3 “What Really Happens When Emissions Vanish”, Ben Elgin and Sinduja Rangarajan, Bloomberg.com, October 31, 2002.  2 1. The requirements should recognize that improving climate disclosures is a process and should be focused on what is material. The goal should be to inform investors as to the current stage of their climate journey and how the company plans to improve. Requiring companies to move from no disclosure to zip code level or 1% materiality level disclosures even if phased in over several years, is unlikely to result in useful information to investors while placing high-cost burdens on companies, risking the entire rules being overturned and distracting, or even discouraging, companies from actually investing to reduce carbon or lower their climate risk.   2. Climate disclosure should be added to and focused in the MD&A section of the 10K The current MD&A requirements (Item 303) requires disclosure of information relevant to a company’s financial condition and addresses a number of items material to investors including liquidity and capital resources  Given this section is intended to address items material to investors, it would seem appropriate that any climate disclosures, including TCFD disclosures, be included in Item 303 by adding a new section to include risks, organizational structure and the financial impact modeled on TCFD.  Like other material information in the MD&A, management should be able to tailor the disclosure to what is material to the business and investors and carry similar liability to the rest of 303. 3. Both the companies and the rules need to have the ability to provide for innovation and improvement It is highly unlikely that the SEC rulemaking process, especially if there is a change in administrations, will be able to keep up with the rapidly changing climate solutions market and changes in reporting methods like Scope 2. While the climate related frameworks may be widely used, as the above quoted articles discuss, they are not mature and may in fact, be misleading or encourage behaviors that actually increases greenhouse gas emissions.  Many forward-thinking organizations are trying to develop new and improved methods of reporting, or of reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, and the existing frameworks or proposed rules, especially with associated legal liability may not allow these practices or not reward the additional effort to implement them.  Establishing the rules in the format of the currently proposed hard standards that require rule making for changes instead of guiding principles will likely result in rules that are quickly outdated and thus more likely to be successfully challenged in a multi-year court process. 4. Justification for attestation requirement is not likely to hold up to a lawsuit and it is far more important to require disclosure of the use of offsets, recs and credits. The Proposed Disclosure the attestation requirement because the information is “not derived from the books and records used to generate the audited financial statements.4”  However, this justification is incorrect as the calculation for Scope 1 and 2 is based on electricity, coal, natural gas or other energy used which is billed, recorded and paid through the accounts payable system, an integral input into the audited financial statements and a focus of any SOX controls.  Thus, the only part of the calculation that is not part of the accounting system and SOX controls is the emissions factor that typically comes from a third party (like the EPA). As discussed in the articles, requiring more details around where energy is used and any offsets, recs or credits claimed would be much more helpful than attestation.  4 Proposed Disclosure pg. 220 to 221  3 I am happy to answer any questions or provide additional information and for making changes to the rules that will allow for more flexibility and impact and hopefully help to reduce carbon emissions Thank you for considering my comments.

 I. The Proposed Rule Is a Major Rule 
In the Proposing Release, the SEC seeks comment on whether the Proposed Rule would 
be a “major rule” for purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 
1996 (“SBREFA”).3  It is clear that the Proposed Rule would constitute a major rule under the 
SBREFA based on its anticipated economic impacts. As such, the rulemaking should adhere to the information and procedural requirements applicable to major rules under the Congressional Review Act (“CRA”) —including the requirement for submitta l of a report to each House of 
Congress designating the Proposed Rule as a “major rule” and the 60-day waiting period before a finalized “major rule” can take effect. If these important procedural protections are not observed, we are concerned that the SEC ’s rulemaking process would deprive both the Commission and 
the public of the time and information needed to adequately analyze the significant economic and other impacts of the Proposed Rule. 
The SBREFA  defines “major rule” as “any rule that the Administr ator of the Office of 
Information  and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget finds has resulted 
in or is likely to result in —(A) an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or more . . . ”
4  
Congress and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (“OIRA”) have both specifically 
indicated that compliance costs should be included in assessing whether rulemaking meets the economic threshold for classification as a “major rule” under the SBREFA.
5 While the Proposing 
Release indicates that direct costs to attain compliance “could potentially be significant,” it also notes potential indirect costs including additional litigation risk and compelled disclosure of proprietary information that may be competitively disadvantageous to the company.
6  
The SEC’s own compliance cost estimates clearly show that the Proposed Rule is a major 
rule. PRA Table 4 of the Proposing Release estimates that issuer external costs will increase by 
 
3 Proposing Release at  450. In particular , the Proposing Rel ease requests comment on:  
• The potential effect on the U.S. economy on an annual basis;  
• Any potential increase in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries; and 
• Any potential adverse effect on competition, investment, or innovation.  
4 Small Bu siness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 at §80 4(2); See also SEC, Rulemaking Process  (July 
2002) (“The primary element of the major rule analysis is whether the rule is likely to have an annual effect on the 
economy of $100 million or more”) (last accessed October 20, 2022). The $100 million threshold is identical to the monetary threshold for determining whether a rul e is “major” under the Congressional Review Act (which was 
enacted as part of the SBREFA) or “economically significant” under Executive Order 12866. See The Congressional 
Review Act (CRA): Frequently As ked Questions  (Nov. 2021) at 2;  OIRA, Regulatory Impact Analysis: Frequently 
Asked Questions (FAQs)  a t 2.   
5 OIRA, Regulatory Impact Analysis: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) at 1. (“The $100 million threshold 
applies to the impact of the proposed or final regulation in any one year, and it includes benefits, costs, or transfers. (The word “or” is important: $100 million in annual benefits , or costs, or transfers is sufficient; $50 million in 
benefits and $49 million in costs, for example, is not.”)); 
The Congressional Review Act (CRA): Frequently Asked 
Questions  ( Nov. 2021) at 10 (“ Rules can meet the economic threshold for classification as a major rule ($100

transfers of funds, pro mpt consumer spending, establish user fees, or result in cost savings for consumers and 
taxpayers”).  
6 Proposing Release at 371, 388- 89. 3 
 nearly $6.4 billion.7 The SEC further estimates that the annual internal cost  of compliance for at 
least the first five years after  the initial year of compliance would be $120,000 for a smaller 
reporting company (SRC) and $150,000 for a non- SRC (estimated outside professional costs are 
substantially  higher).8 Given that the Proposing Release indicates that, based on 2020 data, there 
were approximately 3,850 affected non-SRC filers and 3,110 affected SRC filers,9 a rough 
estimate of the aggregate annual internal  compliance costs alone for both class es of filers based 
on the SEC’s estimated compliance costs would be nearly $1 billion, far exceeding the economic 
threshold under the SB REFA .  
Furthermore, we believe that the Proposing Release has significantly underestimated 
compliance costs.10 All of th e approximately 140 Society issuer members who participated in the 
comment letter process and that specifically weighed in on this issue indicated that their company believes that the Proposing Release significantly underestimated  the implementation 
and ongoing compliance costs. As detailed  in the Society Comment Letter, the Society believes 
the Commission’s estimates meaningfully underestimate the costs to implement and effect ongoing compliance with the Proposed Rule, including those relating to the scope and granularity of the proposed disclosure (both within and outside of the financial statements); the requirement to disclose certain information in SEC filings without regard to materiality; the 
development of new systems, processes, and controls; the hiring of additional internal staff and 
outside consultants; and the audit- related and attestation requirements .
11  
To illustrate the magnitude of these anticipated additional compliance costs, the Society 
Comment Letter provided rough estimates from several of our issuer members  across industries 
and sizes .12 As detailed in Appendix A- 2 of the Society Comment Letter, a few large cap 
companies estimated their costs of initial implementation to be between $5 million and at least 
 
7 Proposing Release PRA Table 4 at 440- 41 (“Change in External Costs ”). The table shows a “Current External Cost 
Burden” of $3.9 billion and a “Change in External Costs” of $6.4 billion, resulting in a requested “External Cost 
Burden” of $10.2 billion, reflecting a substantial increase in estimated SEC filing disclosure compliance costs. 
8 Proposing Release at 373. Costs were estimated over the first six years of compliance with the Proposed Rule. For 
non-SRC registrants, the costs in the first year of compliance are estimated to be $640,000 ($180,000 for internal 
costs and $460,000 for outside professional costs), while annual costs in subsequent years are estimated to be $530,000 ($150,000 for internal costs and $380,000 for outside professional costs). For SRC registrants, the costs in the first year of compliance are estimated to be $490 ,000 ($140,000 for internal costs and $350,000 for outside 
professional costs), while annual costs in subsequent years are estimated to be $420,000 ($ 120,000 for internal costs 
and $300,000 for outside professional costs.  
9 Proposing Release at 432 note 1057.  
10 For all issuers other than smaller reporting companies, excluding assurance costs, the Proposing Release estimates 
initial compliance costs of $640,000 ($180,000 for internal costs and $460,000 for outside professional costs) and annual ongoing compliance costs of $530,000 ($150,000 for internal costs and $380,000 for outside professional costs). 
 For accelerated filers, the Proposing Release estimates current third -party assurance costs at $30,000 to 
$60,000 (with a median of $45,000) for limited assurance and $50,000 to $100,000 (with a median of  
$75,000) for reasonable assurance. Large accelerated filers are expected to incur costs ranging from $75,000 to $145,000 (with a median of $110,000) for limited assurance and $115,000 to $235,000 (with a median of $175,000) for reasonable assurance. Proposing Release at 382 -83.

which, although anticipated to be at the low end of the range based on its business model (i.e., single line of business) and thus not representative of other companies, of $650,000 to $1.5 million, and upwards of an additional $650,000 per year in ongoing expenses, in addition to its current expenditures, to comply with the Proposed Rule.  
Based on the foregoing figures from our members, we believe that  the resulting internal 
compliance costs will be much greater than the nearly $1 billion estimate (based on the SEC’s estimates, noted above), and unquestionably well in excess of the $100,000,000 economic threshold under the SBREFA.   
Furthermore, data rele ased subsequent to the Society Comment Letter indicates that key 
assumptions in the Proposing Release regarding the prevalence of TCFD-aligned disclosure overestimate actual prevalence.
13 Notably, in October 2022, the TCFD released its 2022 Status 
Report,14 which reaffirms that the TCFD framework is still not widely used worldwide, let alone 
in North America , and highlights significant variations in the prevalence and scope of disclosure 
across each of the 11 recommended disclosures across regions, industries, and company sizes. (We have summarized key data points from this current report in the Appendix of this letter .)
15 
The SEC’s compliance cost  and burden estimate s appear to be premised on the assumption that 
TCFD -aligned disclosure is  much more widespread than it actually is.16 
The issuer input and empirical cost data included in the Society Comment Letter, as well 
as the information in TCFD’s 2022 Status Report, should inform the Commission’s “major rule” determination. However, even absent additional data and even assuming the SEC’s estimated compliance costs  are generally accurate, the Proposed Rule would still be a “major rule” based 
on the SEC’s anticipated compliance costs alone.  
II. The Procedural Protections that Accompany Major Rule Designations A re 
Important for Companies Subject to the Proposed Rule  
Given the significant costs that this rulemaking will impose on public companies and the 
economy more generally, the Society believes that the Commission should have designated the climate rulemaking as a “major rule” in the Proposing Release rather than seeking public comment on that topic.   
The determination of a “major rule” under the SBREFA triggers critical  procedural 
protections—most notably a 60- day Congressional review period before a final rule takes 
effect —that would help both small and large companies better prepare for initial compliance. 
 
13 See Society Comment Letter at 23 -4 and note 58.  
14 See TCFD, Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures 2022 Status Report  (Oct. 2022)  
15 See also  Society Comment Letter pages 23- 43 and Appendix A -2, which include the Society’s benchmarking of 
the curr ent prevalence of TCFD -aligned disclosure and voluntary compliance with certain other requirements under 
the Proposed Rule (e.g., Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions disclosure and third -party attestation) . 
16 See, e.g., supra  note 1 3 and Proposing Release at 3 4-5 (“The TCFD framework has been widely accepted by 
issuers, investors, and other market participants, and, accordingly, we believe that proposing rules based on the 
TCFD framework may facilitate achieving this balance between eliciting better disclosure and limiting compliance 
costs .”) 5 
 The SB REFA also imposes additional obligations on federal agencies, which are intended to 
mitig ate the impact of proposed rule making on small businesses.17     
The effective date of the final rule is important to Society members because companies 
will need sufficient time to prepare for compliance. Given the complexity of the Proposed Rule 
and the a ssociated mandates , we are concerned about the SEC’s statement in the Proposing 
Release that compliance for some companies would begin with respect to fiscal year 2023 if the rules are finalized in 2022.
18 Companies would essentially need to act now (with two months left 
in 2022 after the closing of the reopened comment period) to take all the necessary steps internally to become compliance- ready for fiscal year 2023. 
 
III. A More Reasonable Compliance Schedule Is Necessary  
As noted in the Society Comment Letter, a realistic and reasonable compliance timeline 
is critical to allow companies adequate time to —among other things —establish and implement 
the necessary processes, systems, and controls, and hire/retain adequate st affing; develop or 
upgrade technology to better collect and aggregate data; and retain outside consultants and other internal and external resources to effect compliance.  
We therefore reiterate the importance of a sequential, layered phase- in schedule bas ed on 
the degree of preparation, data, and external resources required for compliance. Our suggested 
schedule begins with qualitative disclosures, proceeds with quantitative non- financial statement 
disclosures, and then adds financial statement disclosures , if any. For your convenience, below is 
an updated suggested compliance schedule, which assumes a final rule in 2023.
19   
 
17 Under the SBREFA, federal agencies are required to: produce Small Entity Compliance Guides for some rules;  
be responsive to small business inquiries about compliance with the agency ’s regulations; submit final rules to 
Congress for review; have a penalty reduction policy for small businesses; and involve small businesses in the 
development of some proposed rules through Small Business Advocacy Review Panels.  
18 See, e.g.,  Proposing Release at 46.  
19 This schedule depicted here merely updates the schedule included in the Society C omment Letter at page 80, 
which assumed a final rule adoption by December 31, 2022.  It is otherwise subject to the same caveats as noted in 
the Society Comment Letter.  6 
  
If a final rule is not adopted in 2022, we respectfully request the timelines be further adjusted as 
illustrated above to account for such delay. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Respectfully submitted,

 Appendix  
Based on a review of 1,434 companies that reported in each of 2019, 2020, and 2021, only 4% 
of companies  disclosed across all 11 recommended disclosures.20 On average, companies 
addressed  4.2 of the 11 recommended disclosures .21 The disclosure rate among North 
American companies specifically averaged 29% across all 11 recommended disclosures , 
ranging from a low of 7% disclosing of the resilience of the company’s strategy under different climate -related scenarios to a high of 61% disclosing information about climate- related risks and 
opportunities in their 2021 reports.
22 The jurisdictional breakdown by TCFD disclosure 
recommendation is set out here:   
 
Logically, disclosures further varied in frequency and focus across the eight industries reviewed, 
with Energy companies having the highest disclosure rate across all 11 recommendations (43%) 
 
20 TCFD 2022 Status Report  at 5. 40% disclosed in line with at least five, and 80% disclosed in line with at least 
one, of the recommended disclosures.  
21 TCFD 2022 Status R eport  at 6. 
22 TCFD 2022 Status Report  at 5, 16. 
8 
 compared to, for example, Technology and Media, which had the lowest disclosure rate across 
all 11 recommendations (15%).23  
 
Also, importantly, as was the case with the results revealed in the prior year TCFD report, the 
rate of TCFD -aligned reporting generally corresponds with company size, with 49% of 
companies with market caps greater than $12.2B making TCFD-aligned disclosure compared to 
37% of companies with market caps of $3.4B–$12.2B, and 29% of companies with market 
caps below $3.4B.24  
 
Notably, the SEC estimated that of the 6,220 domestic registrants during calendar year 2020 that 
would be subject to the Proposed Rule, approximately 50% were smaller reporting companies 
and 58% were non- accelerated filers.25

The flaws in the Commission’s proposal are not just errors of substance, but of process.  
Simply put, the Commission is moving too quickly.  As the Chamber previously warned , the speed 
at which the Commission has been seeking to push through a huge volume of proposals has risked 
depriving even the Commission’s own staff of the time needed to develop thoughtful, properly 
tailored rule proposals.21  The Chamber’s warnings have borne out.  The Commission recently 
reported that its own systems have been unable even to capture all of the public comments the 
Commission has received,22 let alone facilitate a thorough review of those comments.  The 
Commission’s Inspector General has i dentified other difficulties still.  In a report attached as 
Exhibit A, the Inspector General highlighted concerns from managers in numerous SEC divisions 
that the Commission’s “more aggressive [rulemaking] agenda” has “limit[ed] the time available 
for staff research and analysis.”23  The staff has not “received as much feedback during the

 rulemaking process, either as a result of shortened timelines during the drafting process or because 
of shortened public comment periods.”24  The staff is also shorthande d, and thus has been “relying 
on detailees, in some cases with little or no experience in rulemaking.”25  The Commission should 
proceed at a more manageable pace that ensures stakeholders are able to provide the input the 
Commission needs, and which gives the Commission the time it requires to do its important job 
properly.

Street Comments 5 (“We do not agree with the Commission’s proposal to require registrants to include quantitative 
information about climate -related financial risks and climate -related financial metrics in their financial statements.  
The introduction of any percentage threshold for such disclosure —particularly calibrated at 1%, on a line -by-line 
basis—would be a huge operational burden given registrant s have to monitor and perform the calculation on a 
quarterly basis.  Such a low threshold would be a significant departure from the well -established U.S. GAAP 
accounting definition of materiality, and also has no premise in TCFD.”).

118 The private sector is continually innovating.  For example, at the r ecent White House Summit for 
Advanced Air Mobility, government officials noted that 20% of CO2 emissions are generated from wildfires and that, 
on the day of the summit, there were 53 active wildfires in the United States.  Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS),  
being developed by the private sector, provide an important step forward in combatting wildfires.  Unlike current 
aircraft and helicopters, whose fire -fighting operations are hampered by smoke, fog and darkness, advances in UAS  
16 
 
 
 
may allow for firefighting against wildfires to operate continuously in a 24 -hour period.  This innovation will help to 
mitigate CO2 emissions and the impact of wildfires on the environment.

137 It is important to recall that climate -related information “is just one piece of information among many 
other factors that inform an investment decision.”  Overdahl Report ¶  34.  So determining the final 10% of variation 
in a company’s GHG emissions is ju st a small part of a company’s overall valuation, with other factors, such as “cash 
flows, profitability, industry segment, company size, and the like” informing the analysis.  Id.

TO: Gary Gensler , Chair 
FROM: Nicho las
 Padilla , Jr., Actin g Inspector General 
SUBJECT: The Ins pector General’s Statement on the SEC’s Management and Performance 
Challenges, October 2022 
The Reports Consolidation Act of 2000 requires the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission’s (SEC or agency) Office of Inspector General to identify and report annually on 
the most serious management and performance challenges facing the SEC.1 In deciding 
whether to identify an area as a challenge, we consider its significance in relation to the SEC’s 
mission; its susceptibility to fraud, waste, and abuse; and the SEC’s progress in addressing the 
challenge. We compiled the attached statement on the basis of our past and ongoing audit, evaluation, investigation, and review work; our knowledge of the SEC’s programs and operations; and information from the U.S. Government Accountability Office and SEC 
management and staff. We reviewed the agency’s response to prior years ’ statement s, and 
assessed its efforts to address recommendations for corrective action related to persistent 
challenges. We previously provided a draft of this statement to SEC officials and considered all 
comments received when finalizing the statement. As we begin fiscal year 2023 , we again 
identified the following as areas where the SEC faces management and performance 
challenges to varying degrees: 
• Meeting Regulatory Oversight Responsibilities 
• Protecting Systems and Data 
• Improving Contract Management 
• Ensuring Effective Human Capital Management 
Information on the challenge areas and the corresponding audit, evaluation, investigation, or 
review work are discussed in the attachment. If you have any questions, please contact me or 
Rebecca L. Sharek, Deputy Inspector General for Audits, Evaluations, and Special Projects.

 SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SEC’s Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 
We met with managers from the SEC’s divisions of Trading and Markets, Investment Management, 
Corporation Finance, and Economic and Risk Analysis, some of whom raised concerns about increased 
risks and difficulties managing resources and other mission- related work because of the increase in the 
SEC’s rulemaking activities. For example, some reported an overall increase in attrition (discussed further 
on page 21 of this document) and difficulties hiring individuals with rulemaking experience. In the interim, 
managers reported relying on detailees, in some cases with little or no experience in rulemaking. Others 
told us that they may have not received as much feedback during the rulemaking process, either as a 
result of shortened timelines during the drafting process or because of shortened public comment 
periods. Although no one we met with identified errors that had been made, some believed that the more 
aggressive agenda —particularly as it relates to high- profile rules that significantly impact external 
stakeholders —potentially (1) limits the time available for staff research and analysis, and (2) increases 
litigation risk. Finally, some managers noted that fewer resources have been available to complete other 
mission -related work, as rulemaking teams have borrowed staff from other organizational areas to assist 
with rulemaking activities. 
Furthermore, the SEC’s rulemaking function relies on coordination and collaboration amongst several 
agency divisions and offices and, as we reported in our October 2021 statement on the SEC’s 
management and performance challenges, agency leaders should take measures to strengthen 
communication and coordination across SEC components. Indeed, the SEC’s fiscal year (FY) 2021 Agency Financial Report states that the SEC values teamwork and recognizes “that success depends on 
a skilled, diverse, coordinated team committed to the highest standards of trust, hard work, cooperation, 
and communication.”
9 Additionally, the SEC’s strategic plan identifies teamwork of the SEC’s staff and its 
leaders, along with other elements, as the “foundation” of the agency.10 To support the strategic plan’s 
Goal 3 – “Elevate the SEC’s performance by enhancing our analytical capabilities and human capital 
development” – the SEC committed to the following initiative: 
3.5 Promote collaboration within and across SEC offices to ensure we are 
communicating effectively across the agency, including through 
evaluation of key internal processes that require significant 
collaboration.11 
In response to our October 2021 statement on the SEC’s management and performance challenges, 
agency management re- affirmed its commitment to promoting effective and collaborative information-
sharing across the agency.12 Management’s continued attention to strengthening communication and 
coordination across divisions and offices is instrumental to (1) preventing unintentional negative impacts to divisions and offices when modifying agency -wide processes, (2) maintaining positive trends in 
employee views on collaboration,
13 and (3) achieving the goals established in the SEC’s strategic plan.

13 With regards to the 2021 Federal Employee Viewpoint survey, 71 percent of agency respondents agreed that SEC managers promote communication 
among different work units (a 4 percentage point decrease from the previous year). In addition, 75 percent of agency respondents agreed that SEC 
managers support collaboration across work units to accomplish work objectives (a 3 percentage point decrease from the previous year).

• Moved its Tracking and Reporting Examination National Documentation System (TRENDS) to a 
new, cloud- based platform , which is expected to improve the system’s adaptability, workflow 
capability, and data standardization; 
• Launched a new examination support service, which among other things, assists examiners with 
data staging, cleansing, transformation, enrichment, and analysis; and 
• Advanced its centralized asset verification program , which, according to EXAMS management, 
has enabled growth in the number of exams involving asset verification, as well as the amount of 
assets verified during these exams.24 
Although EXAMS took these and other steps to increase efficiencies, we also reported that controls over 
the RIA examination planning processes needed improvement. Specifically, we found some staff 
commenced substantive RIA examination procedures before management approved the examination pre-
fieldwork phase, and staff did not always consistently maintain key documents in TRENDS. In addition, 
we were unable to find documentation indicating that an examination supervisor notified registrants of non-EXAMS  staff participation, as required. 
We recommended that management (1) develop controls that help ensure timely supervisory approval of 
an examination ’s pre- fieldwork phase; (2) reiterate to examination staff and management the importance 
of and requirements for timely supervisory approval of each examination’s pre- fieldwork phase; and 
(3) review examination documentation requirements regarding communications with registrants to ensure 
they are clear and examiners maintain such documentation in a consistent manner, and update examination policies as needed. Management concurred with our recommendations, which, as of the 
date of this document, are open and will be closed upon completion and verification of corrective action taken. 
As we begin FY 2023, we will continue to monitor agency plans and actions to improve controls around 
supervisory approval of examinations ’ pre-fieldwork phase and documentation requirements regarding 
communications with registrants. 
Use of Technology and Analytics to Meet Mission Requirements and Respond to 
Significant Developments and Trends 
As we reported in previous years, agency management and the OIG continue to recognize the 
importance of technology and analytics in the SEC’s ability to efficiently and effectively meet mission requirements and respond to significant developments and trends in the evolving capital markets. The 
SEC’s strategic plan (Goals 2 and 3, and related strategic initiatives) reflects the importance of these 
efforts.
25 Additionally, according to the SEC’s FY 2023 Congressional Budget Justification, the economy’s 
reliance on the rapidly changing field of data analytics is growing, and the Commission needs to adjust by

25 The agency’s draft strategic plan for FY 2022 to FY 2026 (Goals 1, 2, and 3) similarly emphasizes that the SEC must effectively 
use technology and data.

Although we acknowledge the O ffice of M arket Intelligence’s use of analytics and implementation of a 
new TCR system, the TCR program —along with many other critical programs and systems within the 
SEC—must  rely on personnel to correctly input data into systems. For example, with the handling of 
TCRs, agency staff from divisions and offices must be sure to correctly transfer TCRs to the Office of 
Market Intelligence . As noted in a management letter our office issued in May 2021, we identified 
2 matters of 3,303 we reviewed that were not transferred from the Office of Investor Education and 
Advocacy to the TCR system.28 Moreover, in FY 2022, we investigated the former SEC Ombudsman and 
found that the former Ombudsman failed to enter TCRs on investor matters received by the Office of the 
Ombudsman that warranted entry, as required by the SEC’s Commission -Wide Policies and Procedures 
for Handling TCRs . Specifically, the agency’s policy and corresponding administrative regulation29 state 
that all SEC staff are responsible for entering TCRs into the TCR system or forwarding them to a TCR point of contact within specified timeframes, and “when in doubt, staff should err on the side of entering a 
TCR.” Instead, the former Ombudsman directed staff within the Office of the Ombudsman to refer 
investors to enter their own TCRs on matters related to alleged securities law violations or fraud. As 
previously noted, through the TCR program, the 
SEC receives and responds to credible allegations 
SEC investor protection efforts Improper handling of TCRs may impede 
of possible violations of the federal securities laws. 
Improper handling of TCRs may impede the SEC’s 
ability to timely and effectively protect investors. 
Ongoing and Anticipated OIG W ork. In FY 2023, we will continue to assess how well the SEC 
effectively and efficiently meets its regulatory oversight responsibilities. We will follow -up on open 
recommendations intended to improve controls around the examination program, and we will complete an 
ongoing audit of the SEC’s whistleblower program and an evaluation of Enforcement’s efforts and goals 
to expedite investigations, where possible and appropriate. Finally, we will initiate a review of the SEC’s oversight of entity compliance with Regulation Best Interest and Form CRS.

 SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SEC’s Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 
Evaluating and Addre ssing the Cause(s) and Impact of a Material Weakness 
Related to Insufficient User Access Controls 
In its FY 2021 Agency Financial Report, the SEC disclosed a new ly discovered material weakness 
associated with lack of controls related to user access to a Commission system. Specifically, the SEC 
reported that the information tracking and document storage system for documents related to 
recommendations for certain Commission actions did not include controls sufficient to prevent access by 
staff who should not view such documents.35 This is important because, while the Commission has both 
investigatory and adjudicatory responsibilities, the Administrative Procedure Act contemplates the 
separation of those functions among the agency staff who assist the Commission in each.36 Therefore, 
agency employees who are investigating or prosecuting an adjudicatory matter before the Commission generally may not participate in the Commission’s dec ision-making in that or a factually related matter. 
However, the identified user access control deficiency did not ensure the necessary separation of the Commission’s enforcement and adjudicatory functions for administrative adjudications. The SEC’s FY 2021 Agency Financial Report further noted that, while a review of the affected system was underway, 
action had been taken to remediate the control deficiency. 
Then, in April 2022, the Commission released a statement that provided additional information about the 
control deficiency, along with the results of the SEC’s review of the impact of the control deficiency on two 
ongoing federal court litigations: SEC v. Cochran, No. 21- 1239 (S. Ct.), and Jarkesy v. SEC , No. 20-
61007 (5th Cir.). The statement reads , in part : 
The Commission has determined that, for a period of time, certain 
databases maintained by the Commission’s Office of the Secretary were not configured to restrict access by Enforcement personnel to 
memoranda drafted by Adjudication staff. As a result, in a number of adjudicatory matters, administrative support personnel from Enforcement, who were responsible for maintaining Enforcement’s case files, accessed Adjudication memoranda via the Office of the Secretary’s databases. Those individuals then emailed Adjudication memoranda to 
other administrative staff who in many cases uploaded the files into 
Enforcement databases.
37 
With respect to these two matters, according to the Commission’s statement, agency enforcement staff 
had access to certain adjudicatory memoranda, but this access “did not impact the actions taken by the staff investigating and prosecuting the cases or the Commission’s decision- making in the matters.” 
The SEC is continuing to review and has not yet disclosed the full impact the internal control deficiency 
caused by the insufficient user access controls had on the remaining affected adjudicatory matters. The Commission’s statement indicated that the agency’s review team will continue to assess the remaining

      SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SEC’s Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 
The SEC also has an open recommendation from a recent GAO report on assessing security controls 
related to telework. The CARES Act of 2020 contains a provision for GAO to monitor the federal response 
to the pandemic. Specifically, GAO was asked to examine federal agencies’ preparedness to support 
expanded telework. In September 2021, GAO issued its report , which contained two recommendations 
for the SEC regarding the assessment and documentation of relevant IT security controls and enhancements.
40 Although the agency’s comments to the report state that the SEC expected to complete 
actions to remediate the recommendations by the second quarter of FY 2022, as of September 15, 2022, remediation work was still underway for the recommendation related to ensur ing that the agency 
documents relevant IT security controls and enhancements in the security plan for the system that 
provides remote access for telework. GAO concluded that if agencies do not sufficiently document 
relevant security controls, assess the controls, and fully document remedial actions for weaknesses identified in security controls, then agencies are at increased risk that vulnerabilities in their systems that 
provide remote access could be exploited. 
The SEC also faces cybersecurity challenges with respect to its access, use, and security of data 
available through the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT). Pursuant to an SEC rule (Rule 613), self -regulatory 
organizations have submitted a national market system plan to create, implement, and maintain a consolidated order tracking system, or CAT, that when fully implemented will capture customer and order 
event information for orders in national market system securities, across all markets, from the time of order inception through routing, cancellation, modification, or execution. In its FY 2023 budget request, 
the SEC noted that the CAT continues to roll out functionality as the phased launch of broker -dealer 
reporting and regulator fun ctionality progresses. Because CAT data is highly sensitive, the SEC must 
continue working to establish an environment and applications to appropriately secure the data accessed 
and used by the SEC as it becomes available. 
Maturing the SEC’s Information Security Program 
Effective information security controls are essential to protecting the SEC’s information systems and the 
data contained therein. To help the SEC establish and maintain effective information security controls and 
to comply with FISMA, the OIG annually evaluates the SEC’s implementation of FISMA information security requirements and the effectiveness of the agency’s information security program on a maturity 
model scale.
41 The OIG contracted with Kearney & Company, P.C. (Kearney) to conduct the FY 2021 
independent evaluation and, on December 21, 2021, issued the report titled, Fiscal Year 2021 
Independent Evaluation of SEC’s Implementation of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act 
of 2014 (Report No. 570).42 
As stated in Report No. 570, since FY 2020, OIT improved aspects of the SEC’s information security 
program. Among other actions taken, the SEC refined its management of security training roles and 
responsibilities, enhanced its security training strategy, implemented the agency’s policy for specialized 
security training, optimized a vulnerability disclosure policy, refined its configuration management

actions taken to date, and encourage management to promptly act on all opportunities for improvement 
identified in previous FISMA reports to help minimize the risk of unauthorized disclosure, modification, 
use, and disruption of the SEC’s sensitive, non- public information, and to assist the agency’s information 
security program reach the next maturity level. 
Finally, we continue to track the agency’s progress related to an audit of the SEC’s enterprise architecture 
(Additional Steps Are Needed For the SEC To Implement a Well- Defined Enterprise Architecture; Report 
No. 568, issued September 29, 2021). In our report, we highlighted six recommendations to improve the 
SEC’s implementation of a well -defined enterprise architecture (four of which remain open), and one 
recommendation to improve the SEC’s oversight of enterprise architecture support services contracts 
(which is closed). We understand that the agency has efforts underway to develop an enterprise roadmap for future years, and the remaining four recommendations will be closed upon completion and verification 
of corrective action taken. 
Fully implementing recommended corrective actions from these audits and evaluations may assist the 
SEC as it seeks to mature aspects of its information security program, generally, and its IT program and 
program management, specifically. 
Ongoing and Anticipated OIG Work. In FY 2023, we will continue to assess the SEC’s efforts to secure 
its systems and data and mature its information security program. Specifically, we will continue to assess 
the reported user access control deficiency matter, follow -up on open recommendations, complete the 
ongoing FY 2022 FISMA evaluation, and initiate the FY 2023 FISMA evaluation. We will also review the 
SEC’s efforts to establish a secure environment and applications to use CAT data, determine whether the 
SEC implemented adequate security controls to safeguard information and IT resources during maximum 
telework, and assess steps the SEC has planned or taken to address “zero trust” requirements.

Management of IT acquisitions and 
operations is a high risk area across the 
executive branch SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SEC’s Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 
A growing majority of contract support concentrated in IT services —and, therefore, in those segments of 
the agency’s acquisition workforce that procure, administer, and oversee contracts for such services — 
potentially increases the risk to the SEC. Indeed, since 2015, GAO has reported that management of IT 
acquisitions and operations is a high risk area needing attention by the executive branch and Congress, 
stating, “federal IT investments too frequently fail or incur cost overruns and schedule slippages while 
contributing little to mission -related outcomes. These investments often suffer from a lack of disciplined 
and effective management, such as project planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and 
governance.”52 We have previously reported on needed improvements in the SEC’s management of IT 
investments.53 And while last July the SEC 
completed efforts sufficient to close our remaining recommendations for corrective action st emming 
from that report, the agency has also increased its investments (and, therefore, its potential risk) related 
to IT service contracts. 
Notably, the SEC procures many of its IT services through its OneIT enterprise contract vehicle, which 
has a 10- year ordering period and a contract ceiling of $2.5 billion. In September 2018, the SEC began 
awarding time- and-material (T&M), labor -hour (LH), and firm -fixed price task orders under the OneIT 
contract vehicle, which included separate pools for small businesses only (restricted) and all awardees, including large businesses (unrestricted). As of June 2022, the agency had awarded task orders to 27 
companies, including 5 large businesses and 22 small businesses, obligating a total of almost $450 
million for task orders under this vehicle. The SEC’s Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI) 
collaborated with key stakeholders to advertise to vendors opportunities and specifics of the OneIT 
program. This advertising included a publically available brochure targeted to minority -owned and 
women- owned businesses. OMWI received positive feedback and is looking to expand the concept to 
other large SEC contracts being awarded. As such, the SEC’s Office of Acquisitions (OA) and OMWI are continuing to work collaboratively to increase outreach to minority -owned and women- owned businesses 
and continue efforts to increase the SEC’s vendor diversity. 
Focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
OA and OMWI are collaborating to voluntarily implement the requirements of Executive Order 13895, which states that the federal government should pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity 
for all, including peopl e of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and 
adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality.
54 This advancing of equality includes promoting 
equitable delivery of government benefits and equitable opportunities, s uch as government contracting 
and procurement opportunities, which should be available on an equal basis to all eligible providers of goods and services.

Additionally, recent OMB guidance implements commitments to increase the share of contracts awarded 
to small disadvantaged businesses to 15 percent by 2025.55 To do this, OMB directs federal agencies to 
take specific management actions, including increasing the number of new entrants to the federal 
marketplace and reversing the general decline in the small business supplier base. 
Diversity, equity, and inclusion is a focus of OA and, in its FY 2023 budget request, OA requested two 
additional positions to support a number of priorities, including support for workload increases to review 
and expand diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts in contracting opportunities. Furthermore, OMWI 
continues to collaborate with OA to promote access to contracting and sub- contracting opportunities for 
minorit y-owned and women- owned businesses, through outreach activities. In March 2022, we initiated 
an audit to (1) assess the SEC’s processes for encouraging small business participation in agency 
contracting, in accordance with federal laws and regulations; and (2) determine whether, in FYs 2020 and 2021, the SEC accurately reported small business awards. The audit is ongoing and will be completed in 
FY 2023. 
T&M Contracts 
Since our 2019 statement on the SEC’s management and performance challenges, we have reported that 
T&M contracts (including LH contracts) lack incentives for contractors to control costs or use labor 
efficiently and, therefore, are considered higher -risk.56 Last year, we noted again that the SEC’s use of 
T&M contracts has continued to increase. We encouraged management to assess the SEC’s use of these contracts and to formulate actions to reduce their use whenever possible. In response, agency 
management committed to continuing to closely monitor its use of T&M contracts and “exercise rigorous oversight of these types of contracts.”
57 Management further noted that OA has made a number of 
improvements to better manage T&M contracts, including a new independent government cost estimate guide, contract compliance reviews, information sharing on T&M invoicing, and an automated 
determination and findings workflow for “more robust and consistent support for the use of T&M” 
contracts. To date, we have not fully assessed the effectiveness of management’s reported additional 
controls;
58 however, the annual amount obligated to T&M contracts continues to raise concerns about risk 
to the SEC. As Figure 6 shows, according to data from usaspending.gov , the total amount obligated to 
T&M contracts increased since FY 2 018 from about 40 percent to about 53 percent of all SEC contract 
obligations (which are declining).59 In addition, as of October 7, 2022, 476 of the SEC’s 1,055 total active 
contracts (or about 4 5 percent) were T&M contracts.

Ongoing and Anticipated OIG Work. In FY 2023, we will continue to assess the SEC’s contract 
management and acquisition processes through audits and evaluations and the work of our Acquisitions 
Working Group. We will complete an ongoing audit of the SEC’s small business contracting program. In 
addition, we will assess the SEC’s use of T&M contracts to help ensure such contracts are used only 
when appropriate and effective controls are in place to minimize the risk to the government. Lastly, we will 
report on any acquisition- related matters identified as a result of other ongoing and planned reviews of 
SEC programs and operations, and continue to support the SEC’s efforts to train contracting officers and 
contracting officer’s representatives about the potential for procurement -related fraud.

  SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SEC’s Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 
The SEC is not alone in facing a crisis to retain mission- critical talent during what has been dubbed “The 
Great Resignation.” Critical elements of the federal workforce are in a state of stress. For example, 
according to the Partnership for Public Service, FY 2021 government -wide attrition rates averaged 
6.1 percent, with certain groups experiencing even higher rates, such as wom en (6.4 percent) and 
executives (9.2 percent).66 
The SEC may be able to address some of the concerns surrounding attrition by ensuring that it provides 
for succession planning through robust employee development and performance management. For example, in August 2022, the SEC launched a new program called LEAD (Leadership, Evaluation, 
Accession, and Development) to help SEC employees develop the leadership skills necessary to apply 
for future Senior Officer opportunities. However, performance management remains an area of 
opportunity for growth. For example, the SEC has discontinued the Performance Incentive Bonus program it implemented just 1 year ago. In addition, one recommendation from our 2018 report entitled, 
The SEC Made Progress But Work Remains To Address Human Capital Management Challenges and Align With the Human Capital Framework, remains open.
67 This recommendation —for the SEC to finalize 
standard operating procedures for the agency’s performance management program —is an important 
component of the SEC’s effort to ensure effective performance management. Agency management has 
reported that remediation work is underway, yet limited resources and competing priorities have created 
delays. In FY 2023, GAO is set to issue its triennial report on personnel management within the SEC,68 
which should provide further guidance to the SEC in this area. 
Recruitment and Hiring 
Recruitment is a major area of interest to both OHR and OMWI. Recruitment efforts are critical to 
ensuring a skilled and diverse candidate pool from which to fill SEC vacancies. In its FY 2023 
Congressional Budget Justification, the SEC requested a total of 5,261 positions, an increase of 454 positions from FY 2022, in which the SEC was authorized 4,807 positions. With FY 2022 attrition 
rates estimated to be at 6. 4 percent —or about 289 positions —efforts to recruit and hire an additional 
454 new positions in FY 2023 could present challenges for OHR, OMWI, and SEC management. 
Moreover, the federal government is facing stiff competition from the private sector as increased wages and workforce engagement make private sector positions attractive to both new and seasoned 
professionals. The federal government hiring process also has been cited as a detriment when attracting 
talent to the federal government. For example, the federal government takes on average 98 days —more 
than twice as long as the private sector —to hire a new employee. 
69 During our recent audit of the SEC’s 
hiring process, discussed in more detail below, we found that of the 438 external hiring actions that we included in our analysis, nearly 50 percent took 100 business days or more to complete.

  SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SEC’s Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 
To address some of these recruitment concerns, OHR recently issued its FY 2022 -2024 Recruitment and 
Outreach Strategic Plan, which identifies strategies to attract diverse talent an d to aid in filling mission 
critical occupations that have been deemed hard- to-fill. Such strategies include creating branding and 
marketing that speaks to prospective applicants; developing and implementing a multi -media recruitment 
and agency branding campaign that highlights the successes of current SEC employees; developing a 
comprehensive internal communications strategy; and creating an overarching recruitment, outreach, and 
engagement tool to enhance the recruitment process. 
Given the importance of an effective process when recruiting and hiring new employees, and the 
likelihood that the SEC will be heading into an intensive hiring effort, the OIG recently reviewed the SEC’s 
hiring process and identified areas for improvement. The OIG’s audit report, The SEC Can Improve in 
Several Areas Related to Hiring , addressed a number of critical areas related to the SEC’s hiring 
process.71 First, we determined that management can improve its controls to ensure Workforce 
Transformation and Tracking System (WTTS) data fields are accurate, consistent, and complete. We 
found that: 
• 83 of the 91 hiring actions sampled (or about 91 percent) had at least one data entry issue in the WTTS data fields we reviewed, and almost 9 percent of the WTTS data entries we 
reviewed were either inaccurate, inconsistent, or incomplete; 
• the SEC’s WTTS data continued to include unannotated anomalies; and 
• certain hiring actions were not consistently identified in WTTS. 
These conditions occurred because (1) OHR’s WTTS job aid did not include sufficient instructions regarding the dates and information expected in key WTTS data fields, and (2) some data fields were not 
included on the WTTS reports used by OHR staff to ensure the SEC’s hiring action data was accurate, 
complete, and consistently recorded. As a result, OHR can further improve the reliability of the SEC’s 
WTTS data to assist in workforce management and internal and external reporting of agency hiring information. 
In addition, our assessment of OHR’s quarterly Service Level Commitment (SLC) reviews found that 
(1) OHR did not perform SLC reviews in a consistent manner, (2) the review process was inefficient and 
prone to inaccuracies, and (3) SLC reviews did not align with the SLC presented to and agreed upon by 
the other SEC divisions and offices. This occurred because OHR did not establish clear guidance, 
including in the SLC itself, for the variety of hiring types and scenarios that can occur, or how to measure 
each one. The organization also did not ensure it could measure the SLC steps, as presented, in WTTS and did not effectively use the WTTS reporting capabilities in its SLC reviews. As a resul t, OHR limited its 
ability to rely on the SLC and SLC reviews as key controls for efficiently and effectively identifying areas 
of needed improvement in the SEC’s hiring process, and for collaborating with the divisions and offices 
OHR serves. 
Furthermore,  we found that the SEC’s pay -setting guidance needed improvement and OHR could clarify 
the new hire pay -setting information shared both internally and externally. Specifically, (1) the pay -setting

 SEC | OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL Statement on the SEC’s Management and Performance Challenges, Oct. 2022 
information available to SEC employees and hiring officials was not comprehensive, (2) the internally 
published pay matrices were outdated, and (3) publicly advertised SEC salary information was misleading 
for new hires. We also identified inaccuracies in some of the underlying pay band information included in 
the 2021 pay matrices, and other pay -setting concerns. Incomplete, outdated, and misleading new hire 
pay-setting guidance and information have caused confusion and may have limited hiring officials’ ability 
to review and respond to pay -setting requests. Although it does not appear that inaccurate information in 
the 2021 pay matrices impacted any newly hired SEC employee’s pay, it could have had certain hiring scenarios occurred. We also concluded that OHR generally complied with the key hiring authority requirements  tested; however, staffing case files for 18 of 32 attorney hiring actions we reviewed (about 
56 percent) lacked supporting documentation, including proof of law degrees and/or bar membership. This occurred because OHR did not clarify review processes and documentation requirements for 
attorney qualifications. In addition, OHR’s internal reviews of staffing case files needed improvement. As 
a result, the SEC risked hiring attorneys who did not meet all qualifications required for their position. 
Lastly, we identified a matter that did not warrant recommendations related to (1) the SEC’s SLC as 
compared to the Office of Personnel Management’s end- to-end hiring process model timelines, and 
(2) feedback from the SEC divisions and offices OHR serves. We discussed this matter with agency 
management for their consideration. We made 11 recommendations to further strengthen the SEC’s controls over hiring actions, including 
recommendations to improve (1) the reliability of WTTS data, (2) assessments of the agency’s hiring timelines, (3) the agency’s compensation program, and (4) staffing case file documentation requirements. 
Management concurred with all 11 of our recommendations and, as of the date of this document, had 
taken action sufficient to close 5 of them. The remaining recommendations are open and will be closed by 
the OIG upon completion and verification of corrective action. 
Responding to COVID -19: Workforce Perspectives 
Responding to the COVID -19 pandemic has been a central concern of the SEC, and the federal 
government as a whole, throughout FY 2022. Since the outset of the national public health crisis and 
economic threats caused by COVID -19, the SEC’s operational efforts have centered, first and foremost, 
on the health and safety of its employees, the employees and customers of its registrants, and individuals generally. From March 2020 through August 8, 2021, the SEC was in a mandatory telework posture, 
which aligned with other federal government agencies. Indeed, the federal government workforce quickly 
increased from 3 percent of employees teleworking every day to nearly 60 percent, as the 2020 O ffice of 
Personnel Management Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey shows.
72 However, as vaccines became 
more widely available, the SEC shifted its focus to how to best and most safely allow employees to return to the workplace.

Viewpoint Survey ; April 26, 2021.

On August 9, 2021, the agency began to allow 
vaccinated employees to voluntar ily return to the Safety remains a top priority when 
planning for employee return to the workplace. In calendar year 2022, peak occupancy 
workplace across all SEC building locations has averaged 
around 7 percent. The SEC has not yet mandated 
that its employees return to the office in pre- COVID -
19 levels. On July 25, 2022, the agency announced that, because of the recent uptick in COVID -19 
community levels, the planned return- to-office date was shifted from September 6, 2022, to January 9, 
2023. Occurring alongside the agency’s monitoring of community levels, the SEC is also negotiating a 
new collective bargaining agreement with the National Treasury Employees Union, which will include 
updated provisions related to telework and remote work. The parties are also engaged in bargaining 
related to the mandatory return- to-office plan. While these negotiations are ongoing, both the National 
Treasury Employees Union and SEC leadership make regular announcements to staff and management, 
respectively, about their progress. At this point, further negotiations require assistance from the Federal 
Mediation and Conciliation Service as the parties endeavor to avoid invoking the Federal Services 
Impasse Panel for a final decision on the terms of the new collective bargaining agreement and return- to-
office plan. The uncertainty surrounding the plans for return- to-office and the potential for expanded 
telework and/or workplace flexibilities makes it more difficult to plan for future human capital management solutions. 
Ongoing and Anticipated OIG Work. In FY 2023, we plan to evaluate the agency’s workplace safety 
protocols developed in response to the COVID -19 pandemic, including the COVID -19 workplace safety 
plan and related measures, such as those established pursuant to OMB Memorandum M- 21-15, 
Executive Order 13991, and other applicable guidance. We also will complete a review of the agency’s 
upward mobility program. Furthermore, we will monitor the SEC’s progress in addressing prior open audit recommendations related to human capital management. To assess the SEC’s efforts to promote 
diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility, and opportunity, we will complete an ongoing audit of the 
agency’s small business contracting. We will also assess the operations and controls over the agency’s 
equal employment opportunity program.

Re: Supplemental Submission  by Carbon Tracker Initiative  related to  Proposed Climate Risk 
Disclosure Rule (File Number S7 -10-22) 
 
Dear Ms. Countryman:  
The Carbon Tracker Initiative , Ltd. and Carbon Tracker Initiative, Inc.  (collectively, Carbon 
Tracker) appreciate  the opportunity to provide supplemental information for the Securities and 
Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) consideration as part of its proposed rulemaking, 
The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate -Related Disclosures for Investors  (the “Prop osal”).  
Carbon Tracker is an independent financial think -tank that carries out in -depth analysis on the 
impact of the energy transition on both capital markets and investments in high -cost, carbon 
intensive fossil fuels. For the past decade we have publis hed research on how climate and carbon 
constraints could materially impact companies in the fossil -fuel intensive sectors of upstream oil 
and gas, coal mining, and power generation and utilities.  
As part of our June 17, 2022  response to the Proposal , we referenced  our research  of select 
carbon -intensive companies’ FY2020 financial reporting ,1 where w e found that internal 
consistency between regulatory reporting and other information produced by registrants is 
sometimes lacking.  In October 2022 we published a follow -on report: Still flying blind: The 
absence of climate risk in financial reporting , where we discuss the results of our analysis of the 
reported climate -related risks, targets,  and strategies of 1 34 carbon exposed companies and our 
comparison of this with the information disclosed in their  FY2021  financial statements.  
As well as a lack of transparency about the consideration of climate risks, once again we  found 
internal inconsistencies in registrants’ climate -related reporting  for the companies analyzed . As in 
the prior year, companies did not appear to consider the costs of their publicly stated emissions 
targets, the effects of internal carbon pricing, or the potential impacts of the energy transition 
when valuing assets or estimating such assets’ remain ing useful lives .   
Corporate financial reporti ng is one of the foundations to valuations; the assumptions and 
estimates that are used therein can be impacted by climate change  related matters. Without this 
information, and a connection between the financial statements and “other reporting ,” investors 
have little means of determining the adequacy of a company’s financial reporting and the extent 
to which it may be exaggerating its sustainability story. In our June 17, 2022 response w e discuss 
how the  Proposal could go further  to highlight th e consistency issue here, and other areas .

Comment on S7-10-22
Your request for comment of 10/18/2022
Dear Chair Gensler, Dear Secretary Countryman, Dear SEC,
climate crisis is undeniably the biggest threat to humanity.
Although Paris Agreement has been negotiated on December 12, 2015, signed on April 22, 2016, ef-
fective since November 4, 2016, world's democracy leaders still do not even comply to GHG emission
reductions necessary to reach the 2.0 °K goal, by far not even remotely reaching the 1.5 °K goal. Compa-
nies, especially public held ones, should no longer be able to hide behind governmental efforts in fighting
climate change.
Therefore plantwatch, an open-data platform making Germany's combustion plants transparent, highly
appreciates and supports SEC's efforts on S7-10-22.
Before answering a very limited subset of the questions asked for comment by SEC, I would like to
begin with concerns regarding greenwashing.
Plantwatch's main goal is, was and always has been to make the huge dimensions of pollution by large
combustion plants (LCPs) transparent.
Unfortunately, large fossil dinosaurs like RWE in Germany or EDF in France still believe in the concept of
large combustion plants and therefore are planning and executing projects to replace lignite one-to-one by
wood mined by radical deforestation. They then claim to have retrofitted the plant to be climate-neutral.
Destructing whole forests to burn the harvested wood however is obviously not climate-neutral. The same
is happening with so called green hydrogen and so called hydrogen-ready natural gas-fired power plants.
Plantwatch trusts SEC in preventing greenwashing but wants to remind SEC that only robust rules may
be sufficient in fighting humans' and companies' urge to bypass laws for own monetarily gain. Feeble
rules however are not worth the paper they are written on.Comments on Questions
•Questions 10, climate-related risks
Plantwatch wants to emphasize the existence of attribution as science of attributing the anthropic
factor of disasters which happened. Companies may adhere to attribution to assess climate-related
risks.
•Question 34, board oversight
Plantwatch considers a strong board oversight regarding climate-protection as strongly necessary.
The German Wirecard scandal has shown - pardon the writer's French - that crap rolls downhill.
While Wirecard Asia launched a full-blown internal investigation, as they handed it over to the
German Wirecard HQ a criminal was put in charge with further handling. The rest is history.
•Question 42, process of identifying climate related risks
The standardization of this process could adhere to the established compliance management systems,
which - at least in Germany - emerged from 08-cv-02167 but kept continuously improving ever since.
Just like for whistleblower protection it is necessary to offer save and anonymous reporting channels
but not sufficient doing so, a single climate-friendly person as a figurehead - like Luisa Neubauer,
who refused the offer becoming exactly that figurehead for Siemens AG - is not even remotely
sufficient in ensuring a strong board oversight.
•Question 135, attestation
As Wirecard scandal showed, not even attestation companies like EY can be trusted. It is essential
to the success of S7-10-22 that companies are not allowed to testify themselves. Therefore, a robust
attestation regime is indispensable.
•Question 194, liability under the SEC Act
On February 18, 2019, German Bundesanstalt f\"" ur Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) neglected
the principles, values, laws it was founded on and protected a world-wide, billion-dollar fraud. SEC
should not differentiate between financial disclosure - which falls under section 18 - liability - of the
SEC Act - and climate-related disclosure.
Plantwatch deems it unnecessary, improper, wrong to remind SEC of its roots and refrains from
doing so.
Overall, plantwatch welcomes the enactment of S7-10-22.
Kind regards from Germany,

 Attachment 1 
The Coming Clash Between the SEC and the Supreme Court  
About the author: Kent Greenfield , an expert in constitutional and corporate law, is dean’s 
distinguished scholar at Boston College Law School.   
 As the midterms near, federal regulators are dashing to finalize proposed rules before a likely divided Congress, or Republican-controlled one, dampens political support for their agendas. In their rus h, however, these regulators must now be mindful of another key constituency: The 
Supreme Court’s conservatives—a group not so easily replaced every two years.    
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is high on the list of agencies that a conservative-
dominated court could affect. The SEC has been on a recent tear, proposing or finalizing dozens of regulations. Some are minor tweaks to existing rules, but many are quite significant. And their significance alone may pose problems, beyond the threat of unfriendly faces on Capitol Hill.   
In June, the U.S Supreme Court decided West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency, 
striking down an EPA regulation
 fighting climate change on the grounds that it violated the 
“major questions doctrine.” The Court had never used that term before, and the criteria the Court used to define it were vague and manipulable. The doctrine’s lack of pedigree gives reason for increasingly cynical Court watchers like myself to see it as a way for the Court’s conservative super- majority to operationalize its skepticism of broader regulation. Its ambiguity may be a 
feature, rather than a bug, to the Court’s conservatives.   
Going forward, the Court has a tool to strike down any regulation that offends its anti-regulatory sensibilities, with wide -scope rationales. As such, the case is likely to be one of history’s most 
important rulings on bureaucratic authority.   
In the EPA case, the agency had proposed a regulation that would allow it to force utilities to 
switch some coal -fired power plants to cleaner technologies. What seemed to bother Chief 
Justice John Roberts, who wrote the majority opinion
, was that the rule was the kind of “major” 
decision that should be left to Congress. He did not define how major was “major,” but instead focused on how the EPA’s action was unprecedented, that it would implicate a significant portion of the national economy, and that the agency was using old statutory language to regulate risks in new ways. Also relevant was whether Congress had declined to legislate in the way that the agency chose to regulate. Justice Neil Gorsuch added additional criterion in a concurrence: whether the agency was “intruding” in a traditional area of state law.    
Under these criteria, vague as they are, several SEC efforts may now be at risk, in addition to the historic jeopardy of regulators’ agendas steamrolled by an incoming political party.   
The highest- profile initiative from the SEC also involves climate change. Environmental activists 
have rightly lauded the SEC’s proposal
 to require companies to increase their disclosure of 
climate risks. But an attempt such as this by a federal agency to address climate change now 
faces a new challenge: It is unprecedented, will be costly to implement, and takes action on new 3 
 risks based on statutory language from the 1930s. And as a practical matter, one need not 
struggle to imagine how conservative justices feel about climate- change regulation.  
Also newly vulnerable are dozens of significant rules proposed by the SEC during the past year—on proxy voting advice, insider trading, special purpose acquisition companies, and other 
matters.   
Consider the SEC’s proposed rules for swaps, the financial instruments that some investors use to bet on stocks. The SEC’s suggested rule would require disclosure of such swaps within a day, and to the public. Before the Court’s decision in EP A, the proposal was already under broad 
attack. But now, the rule’s skeptics have an additional argument: that this rule is an unprecedented intervention in a multi -trillion dollar market, regulating new risks based on old 
statutory language. The argument is bolstered by the fact that Congress could have authorized such broad disclosure in the 2010 Dodd- Frank Act, but did not.   
Also at risk is the proposed rule on “beneficial” ownership. Such a definition is important for a host of reporting obligations, a nd the SEC is considering expanding what counts as ownership. 
But questions of ownership have long been a matter of state concern. Gorsuch may have something to say about the SEC effort to expand the definition.  
The SEC and other regulatory agencies face uncharted territory as they contend with uncertainty 
at both the political and judicial levels.  Should they continue to push for aggressive new 
regulations, tempting conservative courts to strike them down with the vague and malleable 
criteria now availabl e to them? Or should they tap the brakes, recast safer proposals, and wait for 
courts to change politically or define the doctrine more precisely? It’s a Hobson’s choice; there 
may be no meaningful decision to make. But regulators ignore it at their peril.    "

RE: File Number S7 -10-22 - The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate -Related 
Disclosures for Investors: 87 FR 21334  
 
Dear Ms. Countryman,  
 
The Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM)1 appreciates the opportunity to provide 
risk-based comments, in response to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC’s or 
Commission’s) request for industry input on climate -related financial disclosure.  AEM would 
also like to thank the Commission for e xtending t he comment period to June 17 , 2022.  
 
The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate -Related Disclosures for Investors2 is a key 
control for “greenwashing3,” which introduces an increased amount of regulatory, operational, 
and legislative risk s associated with the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) and Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) . Our risk assessment shows ; however, that the 
proposed rule would increase  residual risk a s smaller manufacturers  within the supply chain , 
who the rule will indirectly impact,  struggle to comply with  accurate monitoring and timely 
reporting to larger manufacturers , reporting greenhouse gas ( GHG ) metrics to the SEC.  
 
In a coordinated effort wit h our member  companies  and the  manufacturing industry, AEM has 
completed a risk assessment  of the proposed rule  and corresponding risk areas . We are 
proposing alternative solutions  to the proposed rule,  which better protect environmental, _____________________________________________________ ____  
42022 Product Safety & Compliance and Product Liability Seminars. https://www.aem.org/events/conferences -and-webinars/product -safety -
compliance -product -liability  
 social , and governance (ESG) investors , while s imultaneously  reduc ing regulatory, operational, 
and legislative  risks to manufacturers . One of AEM’s  goal s is to provide  safety, environmental, 
and global compliance programs  for the equipment manufacturing industry. This includes 
helping our member companies navigate sustainability risk assessments, access the  tools for 
keeping ac curate books/records , and report ing accurate data to regulators . 
 
Regulatory Risk : 
 
AEM respects the Commission ’s findings: “academic research finds that assurance procedures 
can increase the relevance and reliability of disclosures, particularly for those involving 
significant estimation uncertainties. ”2 However, reasonable assurance pursuant to an audit , 
significantly  increases regulatory risk for manufac turers  and could result in penalty fo r 
companies , already putting forth best efforts to m onitor and report on GHG emissions.   
 
On behalf of our member companies , AEM recommends expanding the definition of “good 
faith”  reporting  already in the rul e and extending the period of “no assurance” reporting  for 
five years . This will allow companies to adjust to new reporting  regimes , without risk of 
litigation , brought on by audit detecting inaccuracies in data due to companies developing new 
systems for monito ring and reporting .  
 
Operational Risk : 
 
AEM recently hosted the 2022 Product Safety & Compliance and Product Liability Seminars4 in 
Illinois, where 398 representatives from 89  equipment manufacturing companies dis cussed 
scope 1, 2, & 3 emissions reporting, full material disclosure (FMD), and risk assessment. We 
learned that o perationally , manufacturers deal with a multi -tiered  supply chain , which poses 
significant challenges when reporting upstream and downstream G HG emissions. Specifically, 
this makes accurate  scope 3 emissions reporting challenging for some and nearly impossible for 
most.  
 
AEM  recommend s the strengthening  of existing  “safe harbors” for smaller reporting companies 
(SRCs), non-accelerated, and non -publicly traded companies, which this rule will indirectly 
impact. Moreover,  we recommend  reporting exemptions, for scope 3 emissions.  Technology is 
critical here, as we conti nue to deal with compliance regimes which are new to reporting GHG 
emissions for scopes 1, 2, and 3. Exemptions for scope 3 emissions  will become important to 
allow time for new technologies to improve reporting and to allow for smaller companies to 
gain a ccess to new technologies for monitoring. This will decrease the operational risk 
associated with reporting  direct  emissions and indirect ( limited control)  emissions.  
 
Legislative Risk : 
 
AEM understands that internal audit is a pathway toward s accurate reporting of GHG metrics. 
Regulation S -X6 of the  Securities Act  outline s reporting requirements for various  SEC filin gs used

by public companies. This is usually a  function  of account ing and audit within manufacturing 
firms. Forms , on which the SEC is proposing manufacturers put emissions data , are audited for 
“fraudulent reporting ” regularly.  This could lead to a significant increase in legislative risk which 
is essentially the  intrinsic point  of this proposed rule. 
 
AEM recognizes the goal of  reporting accurate metrics and timely data  associated with GHG 
emissions . Therefore, AEM  recommend s ESG reporting be done on marketing materials 
regulated under FINRA 2210. Communications with the Public5; Form 10 -K, Quarterly Report s 
on Form 10 -Q, and/or Current Reports on Form 8 -K statements . Adding “Article 14” to 
Regulation S -X (17 CFR 210.14 -01 and 02) correlating climate disclosure to a registrant's audited 
financial statements would only increase residual risk for companies and  liability for 
manufacturers.  
 
First,  auditors do not have the tools to verify Scope 3 emissions disclosed on  the financial 
statement (especially with a 20 -tier manufacturing supply chain). Second, if the goal is to pour 
money into the pockets of consulting firms  by increasing the need for external audit, then this 
rule achieves that goal as written. However, i f the goal i s to disclose ESG metrics , which protect 
investors from “greenwashing”  and other forms of “misleading information,”  then investors 
should be able to see metrics  reported by companies  firsthand through  the prospectus  (or 
other marketing materials)  regulated by FINRA 2210 .  
 
Historically, the Commi ssion ’s review process is not a guarantee that a company’s disclosure is 
complete or accurate, and the Commission  “does not evaluate the merits of any IPO or 
determine whether an investment is appropriate for any investor. ”7 To decrease  greenwashing  
risk for the investor and  legislative risk for  the manufactur er, the Commission should consider  
adding this language , allowing  enterprise compliance  to instead  focus on marketing materials 
review  and not on whether metrics yield limited or reasonabl e assurance.    
 
We look forward to continued engagement with the Commission on this process and are at 
your disposal for additional information and support.  Please contact Johnathan Josephs , 
Regulatory Affairs Manager , at  if you have any questions or would like to 
discuss our response.  
  
Warmest Regards ,

Re: Release Nos. 33 -11042 and 34 -94478  
The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate -Related Disclosures for Investors (the 
“Proposed Release ”)  
File No. S7 -10-22 
Dear  Ms. Countryman:  
We appreciate th e opportunity to comment on the Proposed Release, and commend the 
Commission and its Staff on its thoughtful proposal to standardize climate -related disclosure.  We believe 
that basing the proposed rules on the standards of the Task Force on Climate -Relate d Financial 
Disclosures (“ TCFD ”) is appropriate.  We would like to respond to question 181 relating to the 
Multijurisdictional Disclosure System (“ MJDS ”).   
The MJDS functions well, and Canadian companies reporting under the MJDS should not 
be subject to t he proposed climate disclosure rules.   We were pleased to note that the Proposed 
Release does not propose to amend Form 40 -F to include the proposed climate -related disclosure 
requirements.  We urge the Commission to retain this treatment in the final rule s.  As noted in the 
Proposed Release, the Canadian Securities Administrators is considering proposed climate -related 
disclosure requirements largely consistent with the TCFD recommendations (“ Canadian Climate 
Rules ”).  MJDS -eligible issuers are expected to  be subject to the Canadian Climate Rules, so MJDS 
issuers will also be providing climate disclosure based on the TCFD even if they are not subject to the 
SEC’s proposed rules.   
As the Commission stated in the MJDS adopting release, it established the MJD S in order to 
“facilitate the free flow of capital,” and to enable cross -border offerings in the United States and Canada 
to be made more efficiently at lower expense.  We believe the MJDS has helped to achieve these goals.  
Further, we believe that subjec ting MJDS -eligible issuers to the proposed climate disclosure 
requirements may cause MJDS -eligible issuers to exclude US participants from debt or equity offerings 
and to be less likely to seek US listings due to the increased compliance costs.  We strongl y support the 
Commission’s current position in the Proposed Release relating to issuers reporting pursuant to MJDS.  
If you would like to discuss our comments, the Commission may contact either Kimberley 
Anderson or Chris Doerksen at .

 SEC,

I was going to not comment, because even if you did create a perfect rule, you wouldn't enforce it on your friends that paid you. At least not more than 1% of the profits they made 5 years later. I mean you have to get your cut right? Speaking of which are you ever going to let us know what all that whistleblower money was for last year, or is your silence going to confirm that it was just hush money. I've got a better idea than letting you criminals make the rules to benefit your syndicate. How about we scrap everything the SEC has ever done, throw you guys in jail, and build a new system from the ground up.

Sincerely,
Silence Dogood"

 I fully support this measure. Too often businesses have privatized the profits while socializing the costs. While these rules do not go far enough, they are a move in the correct direction. Greater transparency upfront regarding the climate related risks associated with a particular business' activity can help to ensure that  actions are taken to offset these risks. If BP, Exxon, or walmart are increasing the world's temperatures with their business practice they could and should (in my opinion) be held financially responsible for those damages. That is a business liability, as a liability and risk to shareholders it needs to be addressed. For these reasons I support increasing the reporting / disclosure of a company's climate related risks."

Dear Chair Gary Gensler : 
  
On behalf of over  10,000  Americans who want more transparency on climate impacts and 
goals  from  companies  – including their greenhouse gas emissions and climate targets ,  
The Climate Reality Project urges you strengthen this  proposed  rule . 
 
We have attached the comment letter we have asked our followers, friends, and volunteers  
to sign as well as each signatory’s name.  As you tablulate the the number of comments in 
favor of a stronger rule on improv ing and standardize climate -related disclosu res, we hope 
you count each and every one of these signatories as an individual comment.  
  
Thank you for work and commitment.

SEC -S7-10-22  
  
Dear Chair Gary Gensler : 
  
The Securities and Exchange Commission's new draft rule for climate risk disclosure is an 
important first step in protecting investors.  
 
It’s a great start to making companies more transparent about their greenhouse emissions 
and will allo w millions of Americans to make more informed investment choices – in 
everything from retirement funds to college savings accounts.  
 
But the proposed rule doesn’t go far enough.  
 
By leaving it up to companies to determine the significance of Scope 3 emissions – 
particularly when the rule can also shield issuers from liability if they provide false or 
misleading information – the proposed rule may allow companies to omit some (or mo st) of 
their emissions from disclosures.  
 
Please strengthen the final rule to address these loopholes to increase transparency for 
Americans and protect our planet.  
 
Sincerely,

We are a group of accounting researchers who have conducted relevant research related to the 
SEC’s climate change proposed regulations. We wish to provide initial findings of our research 
for the SEC to consider  as it continues deliberations about climate change regulation .  
 
Before discussing our research, we emphasize that our work is not motivated by any political 
agenda or preference for a public policy outcome. We have not even discussed our political 
views internally since such personal views, if any, are not relevant to the research. Thus, our 
findings are independent to the maximum e xtent possible.  
 
Any climate -related laws or regulations will face litigation resulting from accusations of 
noncompliance. Specifically, the SEC’s climate proposal is expected to increase shareholder 
litigation against registrants for omitted or misstated climate -related  disclosures .1 In our paper, 
we examine how jurors may respond to litigation arising from climate change regulation.  
 
Jurors are expected to judge the merits of a case regardless of their political views. The phrase 
“justice is blind” impl ies that legal verdicts are rendered according to the law regardless  of 
judges’ and jurors’ personal political views. In our paper, we conduct an experiment to determine 
whether jurors’ political views affect their verdicts related to a climate change liti gation case. We 
also examine how the 1% disclosure threshold requirement affects jurors’ verdict s. 
 
Our results show  that jurors’ political views about climate change affect their negligence 
verdicts. Specifically, pro -climate regulation individuals are mo re likely to render negligence 
verdicts in a climate -related case than individuals who do not support climate regulation ; 
however, we do not find a such a difference in a case that is not climate related .  
 
We also investigate how a bright -line disclosure threshold requirement (1%) affects juror s’ 
judgments. On the one hand, an  explicit threshold could  cause verdicts to converge regardless of 
political ideology. Counterintuitively , our results show  the opposite:  a bright -line materiality 
disclosure threshold exacerbates  the effect of political ideology.

 Polls from Pew and Gallup consistently show that Americans are politically divided on the issue 
of climate change. Though strong majorities of Americans agree o n some points (e.g., the Earth 
is warming)2, Americans are deeply divided on public policy responses.3 We find evidence that 
these differing views affect jurors’ judgments. Given evidence that judges’ ideologies affect their 
judgments4 , political views from a deeply divided American population will likely affect the 
outcomes of climate change litigation.    
 
We leave specific policy recommendations to other researchers and experts. However, since laws 
and regulations are only effective t o the extent that they are enforceable, we encourage the SEC 
and other public policymakers to consider how any proposed climate change regulation would be 
enforced in a legal setting given strong ideological differences among Americans.

To whom it may concern: 
 
Our bank does not agree with Washington being involved in our banking as it pertains to environmental social governance. For example, we would not want to turn down a loan because someone didn’t have solar panels, etc. This is just one example. We believe in lending based on someone’s ATR and other Fair lending items. We would like to decide how we contribute to ESG efforts on our own. Which I feel like we do a good job of already. Thank you

 October 26, 2022

 Dear Commissioners and staff members,

The Securities and Exchange Commission's new draft rule for climate risk disclosure is an important first step in protecting investors.

Its a great start to making companies more transparent about their greenhouse emissions and will allow millions of Americans to make more informed investment choices  in everything from retirement funds to college savings accounts. But the proposed rule doesnt go far enough.

By leaving it up to companies to determine the significance of Scope 3 emissions  particularly when the rule can also shield issuers from liability if they provide false or misleading information  the proposed rule may allow companies to omit some (or most) of their emissions from disclosures.

For example, many technology equipment companies like the ones I used to work for outsource all of their manufacturing to contract manufacturing companies, and all of their IT infrastructure operations to data center hosting companies. The electricity used to power these operations are often the two biggest sources of greenhouse gases from these companies. How can we let them go without reporting these emmissions?

Please strengthen the final rule to address these loopholes to increase transparency for Americans and protect our planet.

Sincerely,

Adam Sweeney
Manager, Hummingbird Climate Capital"

disclosure threshold exacerbates  the effect of political ideology.

 Polls from Pew and Gallup consistently show that Americans are politically divided on the issue 
of climate change. Though strong majorities of Americans agree o n some points (e.g., the Earth 
is warming)2, Americans are deeply divided on public policy responses.3 We find evidence that 
these differing views affect jurors’ judgments. Given evidence that judges’ ideologies affect their 
judgments4 , political views from a deeply divided American population will likely affect the 
outcomes of climate change litigation.    
 
We leave specific policy recommendations to other researchers and experts. However, since laws 
and regulations are only effective t o the extent that they are enforceable, we encourage the SEC 
and other public policymakers to consider how any proposed climate change regulation would be 
enforced in a legal setting given strong ideological differences among Americans.

Which is why the new rule from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is so critical. It’s a great start to ensuring that investors know the real climate costs of the businesses they invest in – and can make truly informed decisions about the companies and future they’re buying into.
But the proposed rule doesn’t go far enough.
While the rule will help to improve and standardize climate-related disclosures, it allows companies to choose whether they disclose their entire carbon footprint – including determining the significance of Scope 3 emissions, or emissions from a company’s supply chain – effectively allowing businesses to omit some (or most) of their emissions from their disclosures.
The SEC is open to comments until November 1 and we need your voice. Take action and tell the SEC to strengthen this rule to make companies tell the whole truth of the climate costs of their business. Since this rule does not impose a tax I believe it will reflect a more complete truth.

Re: The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, 
RIN 3235—AM87, File Number S7-10-22 
 
Dear Ms. Countryman: 
 I write to address a single question: whether the Securities and Exchange Acts authorize 
finalization of the above-captioned proposal in light of the grave constitutional questions that 
such authorization would raise. 
 “[I]t is a cardinal principle of statutory interpretation … that when an Act of Congress 
raises a serious doubt as to its constitutionality,” the statute is to be construed to avoid the 
constitutional question when such “a construction of the statute is fairly possible.”1  Here, the 
construction of the Securities and Exchange Acts that would be necessary to sustain the proposal 
would raise just such a serious doubt, namely, whether the Acts impermissibly delegate 
legislative authority without an intelligible principle to guide the Commission.  Because an 
alternative construction of the statutes that gives the Commission the requisite intelligible 
principle is readily available, the constitutional avoidance canon requires reading the Acts to 
contain such a principle—and that principle, in turn, makes clear that the proposal lies outside 
the bounds of the Commission’s authority. 
 The Constitution vests all federal legislative authority in Congress.  Because it “permits 
no delegation” of that authority, legislation conferring rulemaking power on an agency must “lay 
down … an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed to 
conform.”2  The Supreme Court has articulated a permissive test for whether an intelligible 
principle exists; under that permissive approach, the Court has “almost never felt qualified to 
second-guess Congress regarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to 
those executing or applying the law.”3  In recent years, some members of the Court have argued

2 Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, Inc. , 531 U.S. 457, 472 (2001) (alteration in original; internal 
quotation marks omitted). 
 
3 Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).

 that the Court should “revisit” its non-delegation precedent,4 and I agree that it should.  But even 
under the Court’s existing case law, the view of the Acts on which the proposal depends lacks an 
intelligible principle. 
 The Court articulated its current approach to non-delegation in a case involving the 
Commission, explaining that a statute is “constitutionally sufficient if Congress clearly delineates 
the general policy, the public agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated 
authority.”5  It is clear that the Acts do limn at least one such “general policy” where investors 
are concerned: ensuring the disclosure of information that is material to a reasonable investor.6 
 But the proposal depends on the proposition that this principle is not the Acts’ only 
guiding directive where investors are concerned, for the materiality principle cannot sustain the 
proposal.  Indeed, the Commission does not argue to the contrary.  It nowhere asserts that the 
vast array of climate-related information it demands is all material.  In fact, it expressly demands 
the disclosure of scopes 1 and 2 information without regard to its materiality.7  It further makes 
clear that it does not consider itself bound by the materiality standard by asking whether it should 
require disclosure of scope 3 emissions even when they are not material.8  The goal of providing 
information that is material to the reasonable investor therefore cannot be an intelligible principle 
that justifies the proposal. 
 The proposal heavily relies for its rationale on what it terms “growing investor demand” 
for climate-related disclosures.9  The Commission admits that it “consider[ed] such investor 
demand in” issuing the proposal.10  But if investor demand is the intelligible principle on which 
the Commission relies, that reliance must fail, for the fact that some persons want a particular 
policy is not a principle capable of giving any meaningful guidance to agency action.  Millions 
of Americans invest; because Americans have widely varying views and priorities, they also 
would like to see widely varying information in disclosures.  But it is impossible to require 
disclosure of every piece of information that every investor would like to see; such an approach 
would be crushingly expensive and would drown investors in information that most of them do 
not wish to see.  The Commission therefore must choose which information, among all the 
information that any investors would like to see, must be disclosed.  It therefore must have a

 reason to choose which investor desires for disclosure to heed—and the mere fact of investor 
desire cannot guide that choice. 
Moreover, on any but the most trivial questions of public policy, affected persons will 
take positions on both sides of the issue.  The docket for this rulemaking illustrates the point: 
while some investors do indeed favor additional climate-related disclosures, others do not.  The 
mere fact of investor desire is therefore not enough to guide the Commission’s action; it needs an 
additional reason to guide it as it chooses whether to favor the investors who want a particular 
disclosure or those who do not. 
If the Commission is free to select, in its sole discretion, which among the practically 
infinite array of investor desires it will heed, then the Securities and Exchange Acts lack an 
intelligible principle to guide the Commission in determining what information registered 
companies must disclose.  Congress exists to choose which desires, among the countless number 
enjoying some sway among the public, are to be given effect in law; farming out that most 
quintessentially legislative task to the Commission would be a delegation impermissible under 
Article I of the Constitution. 
On the proposal’s apparent view of the Acts, there is no limit to the information the 
Commission may demand so long as some investors somewhere would like to see it.  Nor does 
the proposal offer a limiting principle that the Commission could use to choose among investor 
demands for information.  For instance, the proposal does not purport to show that most 
investors want the new disclosures that the Commission proposes.  Even if numerosity were a 
permissible intelligible principle, the Commission has not invoked it here or laid the factual 
predicate that could permit its invocation to sustain the proposal. 
It may be that the Commission believes the Acts’ guiding directive is not what investors 
want, but rather what is good for investors.  But that directive fares no better as an intelligible 
principle, for it would leave the Commission unchanneled discretion to decide what is good for 
investors.  Under the Court’s current case law, Congress need not specify “how much” of a 
particular good or harm the agency should pursue or avoid.11  But a congressional failure to 
specify which (arguable) goods the agency should pursue would be a different matter entirely 
and would amount to a failure to articulate the “general policy” that the non-delegation doctrine 
demands. 
The Commission does not offer another intelligible principle that could sustain the 
proposal.  It does not, for instance, point to any sui generis provisions of the Acts, such as 
Exchange Act § 13(p)’s required disclosure of information about the sources of certain minerals, 
that appear designed to serve purposes other than the protection of investors.  Indeed, the 
Commission bases the proposal on the assertion that it “would protect investors,”12 so any other 
such provisions that may create goals unrelated to investor protection are irrelevant here.  
 
11 See Whitman , 531 U.S. at 475. 
 
12 87 Fed. Reg. at 21335. 4 
 Thankfully, Congress did not leave the Commission without guidance in crafting 
disclosures; at the very least, a fair construction of the securities laws that offers such guidance is 
available.  That guidance consists of the materiality standard, which the Court has found in 
various provisions of the securities laws.13  To avoid the constitutional issues that would be 
raised by reading the Acts to authorize the Commission effectively to require any disclosures it 
pleases, the Acts should be read to authorize the Commission to demand only disclosure of 
material information (except to the extent that disclosures may be warranted to achieve any 
purposes of the Acts unrelated to the protection of investors). 
This intelligible principle is consistent with the text of Securities Act § 7, which 
authorizes the Commission to specify that registration statements “shall contain such … 
information … as the Commission may by rules or regulations require as being necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.”14  This provision need not be 
read to authorize the Commission to require any disclosures that it decides would further any 
interests of any investors.  Instead, it may be read to require disclosures that would protect 
investors as investors , that is, as those who seek to profit from their investments.15  The only 
information that is relevant to that objective is information relevant to risks and returns, that is, 
material information.  The materiality standard is likewise consistent with all the other statutory 
sources of authority that the Commission cites. 
For the reasons given above, concluding that the relevant intelligible principle of the Acts 
is the goal of making material information available to investors would render the proposal 
unlawful, because the proposal would demand a vast quantity of immaterial information.  
Therefore, the Commission should not finalize the proposal.  If the Commission nevertheless 
elects to finalize the proposal, it must make abundantly clear the intelligible principle that in its 
view both renders the Acts lawful and authorizes the proposal and all its requirements. 
 
     Sincerely, 
     Paul J. Ray

Re: Reopen ing Comment Periods for Several Rulemaking Releases Due to 
Technological Error in Receiving Certain Comments  
 
 
Dear Secretary Countryman:  
 
 The undersigned 18 Attorneys General call on the Commission to extend the 
reopened comment periods for a minimum of 60 days for all rulemaking releases 
affected by the technological error in the Commission’s internet comment form.  Many 
of our States submitted comments on tw o of the affected rules: Enhanced Disclosures 
by Certain Investment Advisers and Investment Companies about Environmental, 
Social, and Governance Investment Practices , Release Nos. 33 -11068, 34 -94985, IA -
6034, IC -34594 (June 17, 2022);  and The Enhancement and Standardization of 
Climate -Related Disclosures for Investors , Release Nos. 33 -11042, 34 -94478 (Apr. 11, 
2022).  
 
 On Oct ober 7, 2022 , the SEC provided notice that, due to failed technology, 
comments to 12 different rulemaking proposals/comment periods  over a 15 -month 
period  may not have been received and logged.  It proposes to  provide  14 days 
following publication of the reopening release in the Federal Register for anyone to 
resubmit their comments. The SEC notice instructs any person who submitted a 
comment to go to the SEC.gov website, research whether your comment is there, and 
resubmit if it is not. This short time period is insufficient to ensure that hundreds or 
perhaps thousands of affected entities are aware of the government glitch and know 
to properly respond.

 The public needs significant, additional time to comment on these rules.  That’s 
especially true with the two climate -related rules referenced above, which seek to 
usher in a market transformation.  Those proposed rules —in effect if no t in form —
seek to reorder public companies’ priorities from maximizing shareholder returns to 
improving climate reputation.  To achieve these goals, the Commission’s proposed 
rules —which sweep far beyond its traditional area of expertise or statutory 
autho rity—would compel public companies to gather, create, and disclose a crushing 
amount of information.  Such disclosures far exceed any information investors 
reasonably need.  And in reality, they would empower the Commission to regulate 
disfavored industrie s into oblivion.  These concerns are even more  pressing because 
the proposed rules rest on thin legal ice: they exceed the Commission’s statutory 
authority, violate First Amendment protections against compelled speech, and are 
arbitrary and capricious.  
 
 Because these rules impose burdensome requirements on regulated companies 
and will ultimately harm investors and all Americans, the SEC should extend the 
timeframe for public comment in a meaningful —not perfunctory —way, to ensure that 
all interested partie s have the opportunity to comment on these rules.

           Planette Inc. Input on Climate Change Disclosures   October 15, 2022  The Honorable Gary Gensler       Chair U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission   Re: Request for Comment on Climate Change Disclosures  Dear Chair Gensler,  We are writing to you today in support of the SEC’s proposed disclosures on climate change, which will require businesses to report present-day climate change impacts, and physical and transition risks (including emissions) going forward.  As scientists with expertise in climate and energy systems, we believe that these proposed disclosure requirements are an excellent means of ensuring that the ongoing impacts of climate change are considered in financial decision making, allowing for greater economic resilience and a more prosperous future for all Americans.    Risks due to climate change are systemic, and permeate through all other risks that companies face, including credit, market, liquidity, operational, and reputational risks.  These risks will increase as the Earth warms further (and as it is expected to through at least mid-century), and are a threat to the stability of the global economy and all intertwined financial systems.  Indeed, financial losses due to climate change are mounting, and will only worsen with time: by 2050, climate change impacts across the globe are expected to cost $23T annually and will decrease US GDP by 4% per year.    Considering these threats, it is clear that losses and expenditures due to climate change, and risks of further impending losses, are material to investors, governments, and the general public.  The SEC’s proposed climate change disclosures intend to make these material factors (which indicate current and future risk exposure) clear, comparable, and rigorous.  Unsurprisingly, governments around the world are recognizing the risks that climate change poses to the global financial system, and similar climate change disclosure requirements have been coming into effect over many different regions of the globe: Canada, Singapore, Japan, New Zealand, and the European Union, among others.      Some may argue that existing frameworks for disclosing climate-related risks are sufficient, such as that of the TCFD.  So why might the proposed SEC disclosures be preferable to those suggested by the TCFD?  We believe that it is because they require quantification of losses and expenditures, and full disclosure of enterprise risks due to climate change, both present and future.  In this regard, the approach proposed by the SEC is much more thorough and rigorous, providing investors with the necessary data to make informed decisions about where to put their money.  Such a quantitative    approach to climate risk disclosures mirrors that expected of companies in their financial reporting, and, thereby, does not facilitate greenwashing.    Moreover, the proposed SEC climate change disclosures recognize that the financial impacts of climate change are occurring today, not only in some far-flung future.  The planet has already warmed by 1.2C above pre-industrial temperatures, and the impacts of climate change are all around us.  Just in the last few months, we’ve witnessed a devastating heatwave in China, torrential floods over Pakistan, a worsening drought over the American Southwest, and a Category 4 hurricane over Florida, all of which have been made more extreme and costly because of climate change.  This year, Pacific Gas & Electricity became the first major corporate casualty of climate change, and there will likely be many others as the impacts of climate change intensify.       The proposed climate-related disclosure requirements, which may seem onerous at first glance, are imminently diagnosable because of advances in climate science and associated data analytics.  Attribution of current year losses and expenditures to climate change is straightforward, thanks to the rigorous methodologies developed to assess how climate change contributes to meteorological extremes.  And physical risks to assets, both at present and in the future, are straightforward to quantify using state-of-the-art observational products (which assimilate satellite and ground data) and projections from the current generation of Earth system models.  Reasonable greenhouse gas emissions estimates are also possible, even for tricky Scope III emissions, due to advances in supply chain mapping.    Finally, many companies claim to have net zero targets.  For such companies, the proposed SEC climate change disclosures would require a clear net zero transition plan, assuring investors and the public that these claims are not mere lip service, but are made in earnest with a clear pathway of action.    We understand that many small- and medium-sized businesses may be concerned about the effort required to assemble such climate change disclosures.  At Planette Inc., we aim to provide rigorous, high quality, company-specific quantification of such climate-related losses and risks at nominal cost.  We hope that such climate analytics services, provided by us and other firms, can help make such reporting straightforward for all companies, even for those without the resources to assemble in-house expertise.    Overall, we commend the SEC’s proposal to make corporate costs and risks associated with climate change more transparent to investors, governments, and the public.  Thank you for the opportunity to offer our perspective on this important matter.  Sincerely,  Prof. Hansi Singh (CEO & co-founder) Dr. Kalai Ramea (CTO & co-founder) Planette Inc.  "

Re: The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate -Related Disclosures for Investors - File No. S7-10-22 
 
Dear Ms. Countryman:  
 
Connor Group, Inc. is pleased to provide our comments on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ( “SEC” 
or “Commission ”) request for public comment on its climate -related disclosures proposal.  
 
Connor Group is a specialized professional services firm of Big 4 alumni and industry executives. Our team of 
experienced professionals helps financial executives with complex and significant matters, including financial 
accounting and operations, IPO and M&A services, digital solutions, and managed services. We  have served 
over 1,000 clients on six continents including a substantial number of companies undergoing initial public 
offerings . Our client portfolio includes multi -billion -dollar public, mid -cap public, and pre -IPO companies 
ranging from early stage to late stage. Since the firm was founded, it has gro wn to more than 500 
professionals with industry experience in biotech, cleantech, consumer products, fintech, gaming, Internet, 
life sciences, social networking, software, and technology.  
 
We believe that climate -related disclosures are an important step toward improving the quality of 
information provided by companies to their investors and assessing the impact business operations have on 
our environment . We encourage the Commission  to strive to attain an appropriate balance in its final climate -
related disclosure  regulations between the amount and depth of information registrants will be required to 
provide and the related costs of compliance . We agree with the SEC’s proposal to utilize the existing Task 
Force on Climate -Related Fi nancial Disclosures (“TCFD”) framework and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (“GHG 
Protocol”), as many investors are already familiar with the two frameworks given that many organizations 
use them to issue climate -related disclosures on a voluntary basis.  Howeve r, we also encourage the 
Commission to work to harmonize the climate reporting requirements across key world economies to reduce 
the burden on companies and maximize comparability for investors.  Additionally, t o the extent the 
Commission decides that it is appropriate to include climate related disclosures in the financial statements, 
we recommend it work to establish the requirements through the existing framework of delegation of 
authority , i.e. the Financial Accounting  Standards Board (“FASB”) , which should  author the related guidance 
on this topic.

Connor Group | Silicon Valley San Francisco  Salt Lake City Boston New York | connor gp.com 
In this regard , we have  outlin ed below our views on how the final regulations may enable a better balance 
between the costs of compliance and the benefits to investors.  
 
Disclosure  Threshold  
 
The Commission’s proposal requires disclosures of impact s of climate -related matters  on the financial 
statements for a ny financial statement  line items where such impact is  1% or greater  based on the total of 
the absolute value s of both positive and negative amounts . We believe the proposed 1% bright -line 
disclosure threshold can result in the reporting of  information that may not be meaningful or significant to 
investors , and would result in increased costs that outweigh the added benefit. Furthermore, applying the 
bright -line disclosure threshold would be inconsistent with the materiality framework applied for other 
purposes within the registrant’s financial statements. It is also inconsistent with the instances where the 
Commission has commented on the use of quantitative thresholds for purposes of assessing materiality. For 
example, in St aff Accounting Bulletin 99 (Topic 1.M) the Commission has referred to a 5% threshold as a 
threshold that “may provide the basis for a preliminary assumption that – without considering a ll relevant 
circumstances – a deviation of less than the specified perc entage with respe ct to a particular item on the 
registrant’s financial statements is unlikely to be material.”   
 
As such, w e suggest modifying  the disclosure threshold from the bright -line of 1% for each financial 
statement line item to one that considers the overall context  of the financial  statements  and the concept of 
materiality as applied in the preparation of the financial statements . In other words, we recommend 
disclosure of impact of climate-related events  that are individually or in the aggregate  material to the 
financial statements as a whole . Applying  the concept of materiality  includes  the evaluation of both 
qualitative and quantitative considerations and judgment s, as could be applied by a reasonable user of the  
financial statements.  We believe incorporating broader materiality principles within the financial statements 
will result in more comprehensive climate -related disclosures , with  a focus on information that is most

The Commission’s  proposal requires inclusion of  climate -related disclosures in the footnotes  to the financial 
statements , which would be subject to audit  by an independent registered public accounting firm  and within 
the registrant ’s Internal Controls over Financial Reporting ( “ICFR ”) requirements . We believe determination 
of certain quantitative disclosures  in the proposal as currently written  requires high levels of subjectivity , 
that is substantially above and beyond the levels of subjectivity incorporated elsewhere in the financial 
statements . One observed example is whether to disclose a  transition act ivity if the activity was already 
planned by the registrant independent of potential climate -related benefits or costs.  Another example is how 
to quantify the impact of specific climate -related physical risks on a registrant’s financial statements , where 
the entity’s performance was likely affected by multiple external and interna l factors . For example, it may be 
relatively easy to determine the impact of existing sales cancellations due to occurrence of an adverse event 
in nature. However, determining the relationship between this amount and the impact on the financial 
statements can be highly speculative , due to a variety of mitigating factors, unknown sales that have not yet 
occurred  at the time the event  occurred , the impact of competitive forces, general economic developments,

human factors, etc . In addition to being highly spe culative, t his level of subjectivity will require a significant 
amount of  alignment of interpretation for judgments to be consistently applied by registrants and their 
independent registered public accounting firm s. 
 
We believe the proposed climate -related  disclosures in the financial statements are more akin to the 
quantitative and qualitative factors affecting the entities’ key business activities, which are captured within 
the Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”)  section of period ic reports . We recommend relocating 
the requirement to include such  climate -related disclosures to within  the MD&A, given that the disclosures 
are related to company’s performance and are subject to more  subjectivity and judgment. While audits and 
ICFR requirements would not apply  to such amounts , we believe the existing level of oversight , regulation 
and liability associated with SEC filings would provide for meaningful, complete,  and accurate disclosures.  
 
Transition Period for L arge Accelerated Filers  
 
The Commission’s  proposal require s that the climate -related disclosure requirements  be included in Large 
Accelerated Filers ’ (“LAF”)  registration statements and annual reports for fiscal year 2023 (assuming the 
registrant has a December 31st year -end), to be filed in early 2024 . We anticipate that implementation of 
the climate reporting will require entities to design, add, validate and test multiple incremental processes, 
policies, and controls  that would enable tracking, accumulation, assessment and reporting of various 
financial and non -financial information for purposes of the newly required disclosures. In addition, t o the 
extent the info rmation will be included in the financial statements, it wil l also be subject to audit and testing 
of effectiveness of intern al controls over financial reporting , thereby necessitating an even greater level of 
management validation of processes and related  internal controls . 
 
In our experience, s ubstantially all of an entity’s business activities generate greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions. Similar to how enterprise reporting systems accumulate monetary amounts that are eventually 
included in the entity’s financial stateme nts, we anticipate that most registrants will need computerized GHG 
reporting systems to accumulate and report emission data. W hile a number of such systems ar e already in 
existence and available , for most entities they will require significant integrations into these entities’ other 
existing reporting and operational systems and  may also require significant customization . A major system 
implementation takes a substantial am ount of time , cost,  and effort. Based on our interactions with various 
registrants , most entities, including LAFs, have not initiated substantial implementation activities  pending 
publication of the final SEC regulations, to avoid incurring costs that may not be necessary  and due to existing 
economic uncertainties and other competing priorities .  
 
As such, given the proximity to the reporting deadlines for LAFs , we recommend the Commission consider 
deferring the proposed ef fective date currently set out in the proposal by a minimum of one year . Absent 
such deferral, we anticipate many LAF registrants will be at a high risk of failing to implement the required 
climate reporting on a timely basis, and/or could face a high risk of reporting material weaknesses in internal 
controls over financial rep orting.

Filer Status Transition  
 
The Commission’s proposal provides an informative roadmap with tabular presentation s of transition periods  
for the adoption of the proposed rule s by filer status . We recommend the Commission also provide guidance 
clarifying the transition requirements for registrants changing  their  filer status based on their annual 
assessments  during the phase -in period . Examples of a change in status incl ude a registrant  becom ing or 
ceas ing being a large accelerated filer during 2023 , ceasing being a smaller reporting company, etc. In a 
worst -case  scenario, the entity may find itself as of the last day of its second fiscal quarter to be slated to 
become a large accelerated filer by year -end, in a year when the LAFs have to adopt climate re porting, and 
having its period to comply with the climate reporting regulations shrink from approximately twenty to 
approximately eight months.  
 
Initial Public Offering s 
 
We also recommend  the Commission add transition requirements for  the proposed climate -related 
disclosures for companies filing their initial public offering  (IPO) registration statements . There are currently 
no special transition provisions for such companies. Initially these companies will benefit from the phase -in 
period afforded to non -accelerated filers, who do not have to comply with the climate reporting 
requirements until the end of their fiscal year 2024 (as per the proposal). However, eventually these 
companies will have to provide climate related reporting as part of their registration statements, including 
for the final two or three years of operating as private companies. An IPO is a challenging period for most 
companies, who have barely sufficient resources to comply with the already existing reporting requi rements. 
Adding to these challenges the requirement to report on climate matters will likely be an undue burden. In 
addition, companies who have not implemented timely tracking of GHG emissions may be , practically 
speaking , precluded from pursuing an IPO ( or another path of going public) until they have accumulated data 
for the period required to be included in the registration statement.  
 
We recommend provid ing exempt ions from climate reporting requirements to companies going public , 
similar to  those afforded to Emerging Growth Companies. The deferral would allow additional time for 
registrants  to implement  appropriate technology along with  formal processes and controls over climate -
related information and data, significantly improving the relia nce of reported disclosures.  
 
We also recommend complete exemption of any periods prior to the effective date of the initial registration 
statement from all climate -related reporting.  
 
Scope 3 Disclosures  
 
The Commission’s  proposal require s that most registrants  disclose material Scope 3 emissions . We anticipate 
that entities may have d ifficulties collecting all relevant data  timely  from third parties  and validating that 
such data is complete and accurate . This is particularly relate d to obtaining data from private com pany 
vendors  regarding their emissions  that would constitute Scope 3 upstream emission for registrants . 
Accumulating their own emission information may lead private companies to incur substantial efforts and 
costs, and in var ious cases may lead to such entities electing not to sell to pub lic company customers, or  
 
5 
 
Connor Group | Silicon Valley San Francisco  Salt Lake City Boston New York | connor gp.com 
being disqualified from such sales by the procurement requirements that public companies could elect to 
impose. Even when information is provided, its completeness and quality may be questionable , and the value 
to investors significantly diminished . It is also not clear how public companies will have to address significant 
corrections of previously reported Scope 3 information that are likely to be required from time to time, as 
their vendors who do not have robust systems and processes discover errors in their greenhouse gas 
reporting.  
 
Information about downstrea m Scope 3 emissions (e.g.,  GHG emissions based on customer usage of the 
entity’s products or services) will be by  its very nature based on significant estimates and assumptions and 
as such may be grossly inaccurate.  
 
Considering the practical limitations of the quality of Scope 3 information, and the potential impact on 
investors ’ decision making should such information be material for their purposes, we recommend the 
Commission consider  the extent  to which Scope 3 emission information should be required of registrants .  
 
Entity Structuring for Climate Reporting Purposes  
 
We are anecdotally aware of instances where public company entities with a relatively heavy carbon 
footprint have taken steps to divest of  those components of their operations with the heaviest footprint  and 
where technology, cost or other constraints make it difficult to reduce the carbon footprint . Such entities 
undertook t hese actions due to the heightened focus on climate reporting and the perception of value placed 
by investors and others on entities who work to reduc e their carbon  footprint.  However, mere divestiture of 
such components does not help the environment. It simply shifts the impact outside of the scope of the 
reporting entity .  
 
While the issue may be eventually alleviated to an extent through Scope 3 upstream (vendor) emission 
reporting, w e recommend that the final regulations require entities to provide transparency about their 
strategies to reduce the carbon footprint through divestiture of operations and other similar business 
strategies, and whether such strategies are expected to result in a reduction of carbon footprint on a n 
aggregated  “pro forma” basis, i.e. taking into account the future emissions of the divested components.  
 
 
We would be pleased to respond to any questions the SEC or its staff may have concerning our comments.  
Please reach out to Corey Saunders ( ) and Aleks Zabreyko 
( ) with any questions.  
 
Sincerely,

The Honorable Gary Gensler
Chair
Securities and Exchange Commission
100 F Street NE
Washington, D.C. 20549
Dear Chair Gensler:
We write to urge you to make improvements to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) 
proposed rule on climate-related disclosures to ensure this rule does not have unintended negative 
impacts on farmers and small businesses and instead supports their critical role in our communities and 
our economy.
We share your goal of increasing investor information about large public companies, and believe that 
understanding a company’s climate-related risks is important for investors to make good long-term 
decisions. We see the impacts of climate change every day, from flooding to droughts, to both heat 
waves and cold snaps straining our electrical grid, and believe those impacts and the risks they create 
must be understood. In addition, we believe that the SEC has broad authority when it comes to requiring 
corporate disclosures. Investors benefit greatly from having comparable information regarding company 
operations like revenue, profits, and assets, and that this rulemaking is critical to providing that 
comparable information on a company’s emissions and climate risks.
However, while large public companies have significant resources to compile and report emissions 
information, we have heard concerns from farmers and small businesses in our districts about the 
proposed rule’s requirements around Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our constituents worry 
that since they are part of the supply chain for large public companies, they may be asked to report 
detailed emissions information to their customer or supplier and face additional reporting burdens. 
While we do not believe the proposal’s intent is to burden small and medium sized family farmers and 
businesses, we urge you to help alleviate these concerns by making that more clear and providing 
additional protections in any final rule. 
Our understanding is that large public companies which currently report Scope 3 emissions, including 
several agricultural companies, do so using estimates rather than directly collected data from small 
business suppliers. This is necessary and should be continued. An example of efforts to work within this 
type of framework can be seen in the dairy industry, which is working to report aggregate Scope 3 
emissions via its FARM Environmental Stewardship (FARM ES) platform, a key component of the 
industry’s producer-led Net Zero Initiative to become greenhouse gas neutral or better by 2050. Dairy 
farmer cooperatives are continuing to increase enrollment in the FARM ES platform but are 
understandably concerned about the reporting burdens that could immediately impact many farmers and 
manufacturers in a short time period if the ability to use aggregate estimates is not preserved. Even though family farmers strive to be the best stewards of their land, many lack the tools let alone the 
regulatory expertise to accurately quantify and report their emissions. Rather than placing additional 
burdens on small and mid-sized farmers, we should continue to allow the usage of emissions estimates. 
While it is important that these estimates are based on reliable sources, this method strikes the 
appropriate balance by providing useful information and disclosures while limiting the burden of 
complying with the information. We believe the proposed rule would be improved by making it clearer 
that this method is sufficient, as the farmers and small businesses in our districts should not be feeling 
the ultimate burden of this disclosure.
We have also heard some concerns about the liability that companies may face based on their Scope 3 
emissions disclosures, and believe more clarity will help. This concern from companies may also be 
leading these large companies to go beyond what is required, and press their suppliers for detailed 
information that small businesses and independent farmers may not be able to provide. That could lead 
to a preference for larger suppliers, and make it even harder to operate as a small business, which is the 
last thing any of us should want. Accordingly, we would ask that you clarify the safe harbors from 
liability to further protect our farms and small businesses.
We thank you for your attention to this request, and hope we can work together to finalize this important
rule in a way that protects the family farmers and small businesses in our districts.
Sincerely,
Cynthia Axne

Re: File No. S7‐10‐22: The Enhancement  and Standardization  of Climate‐Related Disclosures  for 
Investors   
   
Dear Ms. Countryman:   
  
On behalf of Trillium Asset Management,  LLC (Trillium),  I welcome the opportunity  to submit 
this comment  to the Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (the Commission)  in support of 
File No. S7‐10‐22: The Enhancement  and Standardization  of Climate‐Related Disclosures  for 
Investors  (the “Proposed  Rule”). We appreciate  the opportunity  to comment  on this 
groundbreaking  Proposed  Rule that will provide investors with standardized,  decision‐useful 
climate‐related information.   
  
Background  of Trillium Asset Management   
Trillium was founded in 1982 by Joan Bavaria, the “mother of socially responsible  investing.”   
From our beginning,  we have exclusively  focused on sustainable  and responsible  investing  
and have been at the forefront  of environmental,  social, and governance  (ESG) thought 
leadership.  With over $4.4 billion in assets under management  (as of 06/30/22)  Trillium 
continues  to offer investment  strategies  and services that we believe advance humankind  
towards a global sustainable  economy,  a just society, and a better world.  
  
General Support for the Proposed  Rule  
Trillium has long believed in the importance  of incorporating  environmental,  social, and 
governance  (ESG) information  into our investment  decision–making  framework.   As 
investors,  we need ESG information  to assess how these extra‐financial risks and 
opportunities  impact the companies  we choose to invest in.  Importantly,  management’s   
 
 
 
 
approach  to handling these ESG risks and opportunities  is as important  to us as the outcome,  
just as notes in financial reports clarify and support the financial statements.      
   
We believe that mandating  disclosure  of climate‐related ESG information  will benefit 
investors,  and we also believe it will benefit issuers.  Investors  globally are increasingly  
factoring  information  about company’s  climate change emissions,  policies, and practices in 
investment  decision making.  As other governments  require ESG disclosure  including  climate 
change information,  such as through the European  Union’s (EU) Non‐Financial Reporting  
Directive,  U.S. companies  that fail to provide this disclosure  may be at a disadvantage  in the 
global competition  for investors’  capital.  While companies  are free to voluntarily  disclose this 
information,  as many currently do, the lack of complete  and comparable  data, along with 
standardized  reporting  requirements,  may leave U.S. companies  and investors  at a relative 
disadvantage  to global counterparts.   Mandating  disclosure  will thus level the playing field for 
both investors  and issuers.     
   
The current ad‐hoc state of climate disclosure  from U.S. registrants  does not meet many 
investors’  needs for comprehensive,  science‐based, decision‐useful data from all enterprises  
facing material short, medium, and long‐term climate change risks.  And while not all 
companies  currently face financially  material exposures  to climate risks, a company’s  actions 
may still contribute  to the systemic risks of climate change, exposing all actors in the 
economy  to the long‐term systemic risks of climate change. Therefore,  all companies  across 
all industries  should provide transparent  disclosure  on how they assess climate‐related risks 
and opportunities.    
   
We applaud the proposed  rule as a long‐overdue step to facilitate the sharing of accurate,  
comparable  information  that will make markets more efficient.    
  
Trillium’s  Use of Climate Data   
Our investment  decision‐making process includes an in‐depth ESG analysis of companies  we 
may invest in, including  anlaysis of company  disclosures  for oversight,  identification,  and 
management  of climate‐related emissions  data, risks and opportunities,  among other related 
factors. For the companies  that do not report their emissions,  we rely on estimates  from an 
external data provider based on business model and geography,  which may not accurately   
 
 
 
 
represent  management  skill or intentionality  of carbon risk management.    The lack of 
company ‐reported and/or confirmed  data adds to the variability  in the assumptions  which 
support our carbon footprint and related climate impact estimates  within our portfolios,  
which makes our management  of the climate‐related impact of our investments  inherently  
less predictable.   [Q2, Q93] 
 We also use portfolio emissions  data as a member of the Net Zero Asset Managers  Initiative 
(NZAM). As we work towards our commitment  to net zero scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions  by 
2050, our current, interim target is that by 2030, 75% of the holdings 
of our Trillium‐advised 
larger cap‐equity strategies  will have set science‐based greenhouse  gas emissions  reduction  
targets approved  by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). We chose this interim target 
in part due to our concern about the lack of required emissions  disclosure,  as we wanted to 
ensure that our target was meaningful  in relation to our existing strategys’  characteristics,   
and not reliant on a specific data vendor’s estimates.  To the extent that our emissions  data 
does rely on third party estimates,  we may be less able to know whether our strategies  are in‐
line with the Paris Agreement,  which means our ability to assess climate‐related risk on an 
enterprise ‐wide level may be diminished.    
   
Climate information  also factors into our proxy voting decisions.   Without accurate,  reliable, 
comparable  and consistent  data from our portfolio companies,  we must exclusively  rely on 
either paid third party assessments  of performance  on climate when voting for directors,  or 
focus on specific markers and assertions  that the company  is taking climate seriously,  such as 
like emissions  goals verified by the Science‐Based Targets Initiative.  Access to uniform data 
and evaluation  metrics would allow us more flexibility  and specificity  when formulating  our 
guidelines  for director votes, compensation  packages,  and other advisory votes.    
  
Additionally,  our shareholder  advocacy  team uses climate emissions  data (or lack thereof) to 
help in determining  which companies  to engage with. While many of the companies  we 
invest in, particularly  larger companies,  already disclose emissions  data, our Advocacy  team 
often asks companies  to disclose greenhouse  gas emissions.  For example,  in the first half of 
2022, we have successfully  engaged with four companies  with varying levels of emissions   
 
 
 
 
disclosure,  as we discussed  in a recent whitepaper1.  All eventually  agreed to disclose scope 1, 
2, and 3 information,  with a varied phase‐in period depending  on size, which signals that 
emissions  disclosure  covering all scopes is a feasible request of all companies,  in our view. 
However,  it is more common for companies  in our strategies  and in the broader investment  
universe to not voluntarily  disclose emissions  data and related metrics. It would take a 
significant  outlay of Advocacy  staff time and resources  to assess, engage and monitor 
companies  to disclose on a piecemeal  basis. [Q93, 97, 98]   
  
Scopes 1, 2, and 3 Emissions  Disclosure   
We support the requirements  for disclosure  of greenhouse  gas emissions  data in‐line with the 
GHG Protocol and believe the proposed  phase‐in process for scopes 1 and 2 gives issuers 
ample time to accurately  assess and report their emissions.    
  
Given that decision‐useful emissions  information  must be consistent,  comparable  and 
reliable, we urge the Commission  to require scope 3 disclosures  for all registrants,  regardless  
of size or materiality.  As outlined above, accurate,  comparable  emissions  data is important  to 
our investment  process, proxy voting and engagement  strategies,  and is essential in enabling 
us to meet our own firm‐wide, corporate  commitments  to help keep warming under 1.5 
degrees Celsius.   A consistent  scope 3 disclosure  requirement  for all issuers would ensure 
that we are able to more effectively  operationalize  information  and compare company  
performance  against peers, even if disclosures  are reliant on estimates—and  we believe that a 
universal requirement  will accelerate  development  of more accurate calculations.  
Additionally,  universal scope 3 disclosure  is important  regardless  of whether scope 3 
emissions  are material for any given company.  Investors  need scope 3 data from all issuers to 
calculate whole portfolio emissions,  appropriately  manage risk, and meet net zero 
commitments.  In other words, companies’  scope 3 emissions  may be material for us and 
other investors.  [Q93, 98, 99]   
   
While we request that the Commission  require scope 3 emissions  data from all companies,  we 
recognize  that scope 3 emissions  are more difficult to track and reconcile,  requiring a more

significant  resource outlay than scope 1 and 2 emissions.  That is why we are supportive  of a 
longer phase‐in period for smaller companies.  Smaller companies  can and do report scope 3 
emissions.  As described  above, after engagement  by our Advocacy  team in 2021 and 2022, 
four small and mid‐cap companies  agreed2 to disclose scope 3 data, demonstrating  that it is 
certainly possible for smaller issuers to do so with ample timelines  for compliance.  As the 
management  team of one of those companies  we engaged pointed out, where larger and 
smaller companies  share suppliers,  smaller companies  will benefit from larger companies  
requiring scope 3 disclosure,  making it even more feasible for smaller companies  to disclose 
after an ample phase‐in period. [Q133, 134]   
   
If the SEC does not require universal scope 3 disclosure,  we would ask that the SEC require 
companies  who do not find scope 3 emissions  to be material to publish full explanations  of 
their conclusions,  reasoning,  and methodology.  We would also urge the SEC to provide 
further guidance  on how materiality  should be determined  (for example,  the Science Based 
Targets Initiative requires scope 3 reporting  where scope 3 is more than 40% of total 
emissions).  Depending  on the sector, scope 3 emissions  can often make up the bulk of a 
company’s  emissions,  but without a standard definition  of materiality,  investors  are left at 
the mercy of companies  to self‐determine  whether emissions  are material or not. [Q43, 132]   
  
And if the Commission  does not compel scope 3 disclosure  of any company,  we strongly 
emphasize  that for the proposed  rule to be at all useful to investors,  it must require scope 1 
and 2 data from all issuers. Although  we believe there is a robust case for mandatory  scope 3 
disclosure,  tracking and disclosing  scope 1 and 2 emissions  appears to be well within any 
company’s  capabilities  as it is under their direct control in our experience.  Scope 1 and 2 
emissions  methodologies  are well established;  many companies  already voluntarily  report 
this data; and investors are in dire need of a complete,  comparable  dataset for scopes 1 and 2 
at the bare minimum.

Targets and Goals  
In our view, a critical aspect of any transition  plan is the quantitative,  time‐bound targets, 
both related to emissions  reduction  and other climate areas. It is clear from record‐high 
shareholder  proposal votes over the last few years requesting  companies  disclose emissions  
and/or reduction  targets that investors are increasingly  interested  in this information3, which 
we use in our advocacy  and proxy voting.  Uniform, regularly updated target disclosures  
would help ensure the accuracy of our voting and ESG analysis as well as the prompt and 
precise achievement  of our own NZAM portfolio emissions  targets.   
  
We encourage  the Commission  to clarify that the baseline time period and baseline metrics 
must be disclosed  for all quantifiable  climate‐related targets a registrant  has set, including  
water, renewable  energy, etc. Targets are not meaningful  signals to investors  without a clear 
understanding  of where a company  started and is heading. [Q48, 49]  
 
Social Considerations  in Governance,  Risk Management  Disclosure,  and Transition  Plans  
We and many other investors  acknowledge  that climate change is shaped by and has impacts 
on social concerns.  Therefore,  we believe disclosure  of climate governance,  strategy, and risk 
management  without consideration  of a company’s  impact on workers, stakeholders,  and 
political systems is incomplete,  and urge the Commission  to require companies  to enumerate  
how they are overseeing  and managing  the social risks of the transition  to a low carbon 
economy.    
  
One significant  omission we see in the proposed  rule is a requirement  for companies  to 
describe the role of board and management  in overseeing  and implementing  climate‐related 
lobbying,  including  the process for reviewing  memberships  in 501(c)(4) and 501(c)(6) groups 
for alignment  in climate‐related public policy approach.  Additionally,  we urge the 
Commission  to require a discussion  of climate‐related public policy positions and any 
inconsistencies  between those positions and its own commitments.  Investors  should be able 
to evaluate if companies  are undermining  their own pledges and/or the role that the company  
sees public policy playing in its ability to achieve those goals. [Q170]

https://www.proxypreview.org/press ‐release   
 
 
 
 
Similarly,  we urge the Commission  to ask companies  to describe if and how their transition  to 
a low‐carbon economy  is affecting or will affect their workforce,  given the role changes in 
business models can play in ensuring the political will to transition  exists, and the 
considerable  risk of reproducing  or exacerbating  systemic racial and income inequalities  
resulting in economic  loss.  
  
Another critical social factor we urge the Commission  to include is how companies  are 
embedding  respect for the rights and sovereignty  of Indigenous  Peoples in successfully  
mitigating  climate risk, in line with existing GRI and SASB reporting  metrics. Indigenous  
Poeples are the primary caretakers  of at least 25% of the earth’s land, and the consequences  
companies  and shareholders  have paid for ignoring Indigenous  Peoples’ land rights, including  
costly project cancellations  or delays and colossal loss of reputation  are well documented.    
   
Governance   
Assessing  how company  boards and managements  oversee, identify and manage climate‐
related risks and opportunities  is inherently  important  to our ESG analysis, investment  
process, and meeting our climate commitments.  We support disclosure  of board and 
management  climate oversight,  structures,  and processes  as proposed,  including  disclosure  
of board member climate expertise.  While many companies  already disclose this information,  
as with any financial risk, we want to know who on the board and management  is authorized  
and responsible,  and the structures  and processes  in place to manage climate risk. [Q 1, 3, 34‐
39]    
   
Closing  
In sum, we are eager for consistent,  comparable,  reliable and relevant climate data from 
companies  and support the Commission’s  proposed  climate disclosure  rule. Broadly disclosed  
climate data will have the most impact on market efficiency,  and we encourage  the 
Commission  to require more aspects of the proposed  rule, rather than rely on voluntary  
commitment.  As investors who have long‐integrated  corporate  climate characteristics  into 
our investment  process, we applaud this step towards improved  investor protection;  more 
fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and increased  capital formation.    
   
 
 
 
 
Climate change poses a profound  threat to the well‐being of ecosystems  and communities  
around the world and businesses  have an impact on the trajectory  climate change takes. We 
believe we must all take responsibility  for taking the steps that we can to reduce the negative 
impacts it will have on people and the planet.  
  
Sincerely,

Vanessa A. Countryman  
Secretary  
Attention: File Number S7 -10-22 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  
100 F Street NE  
Washington, DC 20549  
 
Dear Ms. Countryman:  
 
Comments  in opposition  regarding the proposed rule ; 
 
“The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate -Related Disclosures for 
Investors”  
Securities and Exchange Commission  
File No:  S7-10-22 
 
This proposed rule would dramatically —and in unprecedented fashion —expand the 
SEC’s regulatory authority and impose an extraordinary burden on American 
employers , fuel the fires of inflation, disproportionately  harm small businesses , for little 
to no  environmental benefit.  
 
1) The Commission Lacks Specific  Statutory Authority to Enact This Rule  
 
This propos ed regulation far exceeds SEC’ s legitimate lawful powers. The SEC’s 
existing authority to compel public companies to make  disclosures of financial  
information does not extend to environmental and social topics like  hypothetical man -
made climate change.  
 
Congress has passed laws  multiple times since the SEC was created to give it 
additional  authority to require disclosures on additional specific topics. It has done this 
because the SEC does not  have plenary authority to make additional demands on its 
own. C ongress can at any time  legislate further on climate change and the financial 
system, but it has not done so in this case.

Disclosure Rules,”

2) The Proposed Disclosures Are Climate Policy Pretending To Be  Materiali ty 
 
Companies subject to SEC regulation must  disclose financially material information 
about  their structure, operations, and plans for the future. That information doesn’t have 
to fall into any  specific topic or category; anything that could affect the value of the firm’s 
shares in the future can be  considered material.  
 
By requiring  specific, prescriptive requirements rather than ones based on general 
materiality principles, the SEC is suggest ing anything climate  related  should be 
considered presumptiv ely material. This allows for, as the SEC’s Walter Hinman, 
Director of Corporat ion Finance, described in a  speech  2019 and again November 18th, 
2020 , a disclosure regime that “keeps pace with emerging issues ... without the need for 
the Commission to continuously add to or update the underlying disclosure rules as new 
issues arise.”  
 
Unfortunately, th is propos ed rule  goes in the opposite direction.  
 
As SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce states , the rule  “tells corporate managers how 
regulator s, doing the bidding of an array of non -investor stakeholders,  expect them to 
run their companies.” Climate -related financial risk that is truly material, as some might  
be, is already covered by existing SEC rules and guidance.  
 
This propos ed rule will impose substant ial environmental regulation disguised as 
financial reporting. That does not  protect investors. Instead, it picks legal,  politically out 
of favor industries and targets them for  destruction .

disclosure -031519  
 
3) The Rule Does Not Pass Any Reasonable Cost -Benefit Test  
 
The SEC admits that the costs OF complying with the proposed rule would be 
“significant,”  but attempts to downplay the burden by pointing to the information that 
some companies already  voluntarily disclose.  The legal and reputational threat of non -
compliance dramatically increases the amount of time, money, and professional 
expertise required, compared to volu ntary disclosures.  
 
This proposed rule will greatly increase  industries ’ expenses  by requiring climate and 
carbon dioxide reporting. There will be substantial costs of compliance. Requiring new 
consultants  and professional’s  climate measurements and climat e accounting method s.  
 
Compared to voluntary disclosures t he legal and reputational risks of non -compliance 
dramatically increases the amount of time, money,  and attention  required . Even when it 
comes to specific  quantitative requirements like measuring greenhouse gas emissions, 
the agency’s proposal states, “we  are unable to fully and accurately quantify these 
costs.”  
 
Take the popular products sold by Nike for instance.  
 
Most of Nike’s 500,000 assorted products  are made by  more than  a millio n workers, in 
785 factories in China, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Products  made from or with 
hydrocarbons.  
 
After they are manufactured, they are loaded on diesel fueled ships with products from 
other companies to be distributed around the world. Each ship ta king a different length 
of tim e, route  and using a different amount of fuel .  
 
Nike’s climate reporting is going to be a nightmare and cost far more than a million 
dollars.  
 
Where does the upstream and downstream climate risk reporting stop?  
 
 
4 
  
 
How much  of the carbon footprint of all store s where  Nike products are sold have to be 
included?  
 
Does any of the carbon footprint of their end users, such as high school, college, and 
professional athletes, have to be included? Do the arenas and stadiums that athletes 
play in need to be figured in? What about all the hydrocarbons used for TV broadcast  
and the Internet where these sports are watched, or Nike commercials are run?  
 
This rule requires companies to report on their internal management processes, 
suggesting that  climate policy should be developed and approved at the highest  
 
 
possible level, involving the input of  senior executives, in order to be considered 
legitimate. This will also increase the costs of compliance  and pull corporate managers 
away from their fu nctional, product  and service focused roles within the company.  
 
The SEC’s proposal also notes that companies will see additional indirect costs in terms 
of “heightened  litigation risk and the potential disclosure of proprietary information.” That 
includes  trade secrets that  would be revealed, disclosure of companies’ most profitable 
customers and markets to competitors, and  exposure of operating weakness to 
competing firms and to labor unions . 
 
Will this further expose the m to communist Chinese or other na tional companies that 
will no t play by the same regulatory rules , if any at all ? Will foreign companies honestly 
report? Or use the same standards and rules? Will those companies , that this rule 
applies to be responsible for the accuracy of the foreign non -regulated by companies’  
climate  reporting data?  Will the courts be needed to answer the above questions?  
 
In addition to the specific costs of complying with this particular rule —which will certainly 
run into billions of dollars per year — the existing universe of federal regulation s must be 
added . Managers of public companies are already working under a staggering burden 
of federal and state  requirements.

4) Estimates of Climate Change Risks, Both Physical and Political, are 
Wildly Exaggerated  
 
Those who advocate for climate risk disclosure exaggerate  the physical dangers posed 
by climate change.  It is difficult to assign man’s percentage of the present gently 
warming the world has experienced  since that end of the Little Ice Age a.k.a. 
preindust rial times. Warming beginning about 1850, long before CO2 could have been 
much of a factor.  
 
In case  after case, overheated climate models with inflated unrealistic emission 
scenarios,  produc e unrealistically high warming forecasts. In addition, those analyses 
ignore the dramatic long -term declines in both weather -related mortality and the relative 
economic impact of extreme weather  events. Climate d isclosure activists overestimate 
the costs of  climate change by ignoring mankind’s  remarkable ability to adapt.  
 
In addition, disclosure advocates exaggerate the certainty and magnitude of climate 
change ri sk. They ignore the fact that there are no trendlines according to the IPCC in 
floods or drough ts. The long-term historic trend lines for tornadoes, hurricane s, and 
wildfires worldwide are declining, not in creasing. No honest person can predict if and 
when the trends of these climate risks will reverse or change direction .  
 
Sea level has been rising about an inch a decade , since reasonably good records 
began a bout 1880. There has been a slight acceleration of sea level rise, since we 
began measuring it by satellite 30 years ago. Some attribute the change in 
methodology , from tidal gauges to sat ellite,  for this slight acceleration. Some question 
the ability to accurately measure  to within a millimeter , worldwide ocean level , 
considering that the ocean is always in motion and there are upwellings and 
downwelling s frequently.

5) This will disproportionately harm small businesses  in an economically 
uncertain time  
 
This proposed rule will unjustly dis proportionately harm small businesses because of 
the reporting requirements. This rule requires that other companies that both supply and 
purchase products and services , from those com panies  required to report , to provi de 
their emissions and climate risks.  
 
Small businesses are ill -equipped to generate th ese types of information. They will be 
forced to hire outside expertise and internally track these metrics. I suspect many will 
foreg o working for large reporting companies. They will suffer an additional eco nomic 
harm at time when many have not recovered from Covid rules and are still struggling.  
 
6) This rule  will increase inflation  
 
Reporting companies will pass along their increased costs to consumers causing 
inflation. These companies will be less efficient in providing their goods and services to  
consumers because of the reasons c ited above. This will also increase costs because 
managers and employees will be diverted from seeking to satisfy customers to an 
additional increased regulatory burden imposed on them by this rule.  
 
Summary   
 
Truth in Energy and Climate respectfully requests that the SEC do es not impose this 
rule on repor ting entities at this time. It will have negative consequences that far 
outweigh any benefits, which  remain unproven and unknowable. In addi tion, there will 
be unanticipated issues and expense of compliance, there always  are. Particularly in an 
area that i s as complex and not easily measured as scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions , as well 
as long-term and short -term climate risks, if any.

Re: File Number  S7-10-22 
  
Dear  Chair  Gensler  and Secretary  Countryman:  
 
On behalf  of millions  of taxpayers,  we write  to you regarding  the U.S. Securities  and Exchange  
Commission  (SEC)’s  proposed  rule to Enhance  and Standardize  Climate -Related  Disclosures  for 
Investors.  
 
In late June,  the U.S. Supreme  Court  ruled  in a landmark  decision  in West  Virginia  v. 
Environmental  Protection  Agency  that the Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)  overstepped  
its authority  in attempting  to regulate  greenhouse  gas emissions  from  power  plants.  The court  
held that the EPA  did not have  a “clear  statement”  from  Congress  to implement  an action  that 
would  trigger  the “major  questions  doctrine”. Simply  put, unless  an agency  has been  given  an 
explicit  mandate  from  Congress,  it does not have  sweeping  rulemaking  authority.   
  
In the case of the SEC’s  proposed  climate  rule, the same  “major  questions  doctrine” applies.  It is 
our opinion  that the SEC’s  proposed  climate  disclosure  rule will ultimately  meet  the same  fate as 
EPA’s  Clean  Power  Plan (CPP),  scrapped  not for its detractors  in the business  community,  but 
for its failure  to meet  the most  fundamental  of judicial  tests.  Given  these  realities,  the 
undersigned  organizations  recommend  the SEC withdraw  its proposed  rule. 
 
The parallels  between  these  two regulatory  proposals  have  not been  lost on those  following  SEC 
action,  including  state officials.  State  Attorneys  General  from  twenty -four states  have  submitted  
a new letter  into the SEC’s  climate -related  disclosure  docket  arguing  that the recent  Supreme  
Court  decision  rolling  back  EPA's  authority  reaffirms  that federal  agencies  should  avoid  
overreach.1 According  to the opinion  of these  chief  legal  officers,  the SEC lacks  the authority  to 
require  public  companies  to provide  detailed  information  on greenhouse  gas emissions,  
environmental  risks,  and what  plans  those  companies  might  or might  not have in place to combat  
climate  change.  
 
In July 2022,  former  SEC Commissioner  Paul Atkins  emphasized  how the SEC’s  proposed  
climate  disclosure  rule could  run afoul  of the “major  questions  doctrine”, similar  to the way that 
doomed  EPA’s  emission  rule.2 For example,  Atkins  argues  that the SEC disclosure  proposal  
relies  on a new interpretation  of the Securities  Act and Securities  Exchange  Act, a law that dates  
back  to the 1930s.

11657659630   
 “In nearly  every  case in which  the SEC has used these  statutes  to demand  disclosures  in the past, 
it has claimed  that it was doing  so because  the required  information  was material—that is, 
financially  significant  to the reasonable  investor,”  Atkins  explains . “But  the commission  does not 
even  attempt  to show  that all its proposed  climate  disclo sures  are material.”  As Atkins  notes,  the 
SEC is “plunging  ahead  anyway,”  despite  Congress  having  rejected  proposed  legislation  that 
would  have  directed  the SEC to do by law what  the commission  is now trying  to do by fiat. We 
agree.   
 
Furthermore,  the proposed rule would  have  detrimental  impacts  on small  and big business  alike.  
The National  Taxpayers  Union  (NTU)  points  out that the SEC’s  own data says “the new rule 
would  cost smaller  companies  $420,000  and larger  organizations  up to $640,000  to capture  and 
report  the climate  related  information  annually.”  The group  goes on to argue , “most  businesses  
who are subject  to these  new requirements  will certai nly have  additional  costs  associated  with 
hiring  or contracting  out to collect  and report  the new data.”3  
 
The official  comment  letter  submitted  by the Taxpayers  Protection  Alliance  (TPA)  adds to these  
valid  objections  by pointing  out that the proposed  climate  disclosure  rule would  also pose 
significant  costs  to American  investors  and unnecessarily  complicate  the existing  disclosure  
framework.4 Major  companies  such as Dow,  Gap,  and UPS believe  the same,  with the Wall  
Street  Journal  reporting  the new rule poses  “heightened  legal  liability,  hefty  costs  and reporting  
burdens.”5 If the SEC maintains  its mission  goal to “protect  investors,  maintain  fair, orderly,  and 
efficient  markets,  and facilitate  capital  formation,”  requiring  reporting  on indirect,  immate rial 
data stands  in stark  contrast  to those  goals.6  
 
At a time when  investors  in the S&P  500 have  lost nearly  $5 trillion  in stock  value,  the SEC 
should  avoid  new rules  that add to business  costs,  especially  one that will cost an estimated  $10.2  
billion  per year according  to the SEC itself.  7 Rather,  the Commission  should  view  the Supreme  
Court’s  decision  in West  Virginia  v. EPA for what  it is: a clear  signal  that agencies  are required  
to color  within  the lines  authorized  by Congress.  Despite  the SEC’s  noble  stated  goals,  
unfortunately  this proposed  rule is both unnecessary  and costly.  We encourage  the SEC to retract  
this propose d rule and invest  its time and taxpayer  resources  in more  fruitful  approaches  to 
educating  investors.   
  
Sincerely,  
  
David  Williams

Re: IMA-NA Comments on File No. S7-10-22, The Enhancement and Standardization of 
Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors 
 
Dear Mr. Staffin: 
 The Industrial Minerals Association – North America (“IMA-NA”)  writes to provide 
comments on the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC ” or “the Commission”)’s 
Proposed Rule entitled The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures 
for Investors
1 (“the Proposed Rule”) which would require registrants to include climate-related 
information in annual SEC filings and audited financial statements.  
Introduction 
 The IMA-NA is a nonprofit trade association representing industrial minerals producers 
throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico. We represent a diverse set of member companies engaged in the mining and processing of ball clay, barite, bentonite, borates, calcium 
carbonate, diatomite, feldspar, industrial sand, kaolin, lithium, mica, perlite, potash, quartz, salt, 
soda ash, sodium bicarbonate, talc, wollastonite, and other minerals across North America.  
 
Industrial minerals are vital to the manufacturing processes for many, if not all, of the 
products we use every day. They are used in the production of food supply chain elements 
(agricultural feed, human baking products, and water purification needs), batteries, protective 
masks, dialysis machines, semiconductors, solar panels, glass, ceramics, paper, plastics, rubber, 
detergents, insulation, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, foundry cores and molds used for metal 
castings, paints, filtration, metallurgical applications, refractory products, and specialty fillers. 
Every sector of industry relies on a variety of industrial minerals to generate their end products, 
making a robust and stable supply chain critical for the continued growth and success of our 
economy as well as our national security.   
 
 IMA-NA members take great pride in the environmental stewardship they undertake as they 
conduct mining and processing operations. Our members adhere to federal, state, tribal, and local 
 
1 87 FR 21334 -21472  2 laws and regulations in order to provide the mineral resources needed for everyday life while 
protecting the air, land, water, and wildlife that surround those resources. IMA-NA members 
often also undertake voluntary conservation measures that are above and beyond those required 
by law or regulation in order to ensure the viability of the environments and communities in 
which they operate.  
 
 While IMA-NA supports the goal of conducting mining and processing as responsibly and 
transparently as possible, we cannot support the Proposed Rule as it is currently written. The 
Proposed Rule is far too expansive; is duplicative of previous efforts on this issue by both SEC 
and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); will be costly, time-consuming, and difficult 
for our members to comply with; and is beyond the scope of the SEC’s authority. Therefore, for 
the reasons outlined in detail below, IMA-NA recommends that the SEC immediately withdraw 
the Proposed Rule.   
 
The Requirement for the Disclosure of Scope 3 Emissions is Impractical, Costly, and 
Overly Expansive 
 
 The Proposed Rule contains several problematic provisions, but the provision requiring the 
disclosure of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by registrants and other entities will have the 
greatest negative impact on IMA-NA’s members. The Proposed Rule identifies three classes – or 
“Scopes” – of GHG emissions: Scope 1 emissions which are defined as “direct GHG emissions 
from operations that are owned or controlled by a registrant;” Scope 2 emissions which are 
defined as “indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, 
steam,  heat, or cooling that is consumed by operations owned or controlled by a registrant;” and 
Scope 3 emissions which are defined as “all indirect GHG emissions not otherwise included in a registrant’s Scope 2 emissions, which occur in the upstream and downstream activities of a 
registrant’s value chain.”
2  The Proposed Rule would require all registrants to disclose their 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, and would require some registrants to disclose Scope 3 emissions “if those emissions are material, or if the registrant has set a GHG emissions reduction 
target or goal that includes its Scope 3 emissions.”
3  
 
The requirement for the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions is particularly concerning. Because 
registrants would have to disclose GHG emissions from their upstream and downstream supply and value chain partners, those registrants would be required to somehow obtain data from those 
partners at least annually to determine the GHG emissions those companies produce, irrespective 
of materiality in order for a materiality determination to even be made. The sheer quantity of 
data involved in such a requirement would be colossal and unwieldy, particularly in a globalized 
marketplace where many companies’ supply and value chains include both domestic and 
international partners that may change over the course of a given year. Such international value 
and supply chain entities may be located in numerous countries with a patchwork of inconsistent 
– or even nonexistent – requirements for tracking GHG emissions. The Proposed Rule fails to 
describe how registrants would be able to acquire the necessary data – if it is even available – 
and how to ensure that the data is consistent and meaningful.  
 
 
2 Ibid, 21374  
3 Ibid, 21377   3 The Proposed Rule appears to assume that such data on emissions by upstream and 
downstream entities, which may be smaller, non-registrant private companies, is readily 
available to registrant companies. This is patently false, as many small, private companies – 
including many IMA-NA members – do not gather or track such emissions data. Even in cases 
where a company may track emissions data, the emissions are not aggregated among each of the 
companies’ value and supply chains. The Proposed Rule itself acknowledges the impracticality 
of tracking Scope 3 emissions when it states that “Unlike Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, Scope 3 
emissions typically result from the activities of third parties in a registrant’s value chain and thus 
collecting the appropriate data and calculating these emissions would potentially be more 
difficult than for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.”4 The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
further underscored this fact by excluding Scope 3 emissions from its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program
5 which tracks GHG output from high-emission sources. That program requires the 
disclosure and tracking of what would be both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (because it requires reporting by electric utilities) under the Proposed Rule, along with requirements for data 
calculation and certification, but does not do so for Scope 3.  
 Given the EPA’s subject matter expertise on this issue compared to that of the SEC, it is 
curious that the SEC believes it can require something that even the EPA does not believe to be doable or necessary. The EPA asserts that its Green House Gas Reporting programs captures 
between 85 and 90 percent of all GHG emissions in the US,
6 making the currently unreported 
Scope 3 emissions immaterial to business and investors. The Proposed Rule would also result in double and triple counting emissions because a registrant’s own Scope 1 emissions would also be 
counted amongst the Scope 3 by other registrants in that same company’s own value and supply 
chains, completely distorting any meaningful analysis of the reported data. 
 The Proposed Rule’s attempt to limit the burden of reporting Scope 3 emissions to only 
those instances when they are material is also disingenuous. Registrants would bear the burden of proof that their Scope 3 emissions are not material, and would therefore have to expend a 
large amount of time and resources to support that position. Further, the requirement for Scope 3 
emissions renders hollow the argument that only publicly-traded registrants will be impacted by 
the Proposed Rule. If a registrant must obtain data on the emissions of its supply and value chain 
partners to comply with the Scope 3 disclosure requirement, they will naturally turn to those 
same  partners asking for the data. This may require those non-registrant entities to undertake the 
time, manpower, and costs to track and calculate their emissions in order to share it with the appropriate registrants. Given that many upstream suppliers and downstream customers do 
business with multiple registrants across multiple economic sectors, the burden upon them to 
document emissions data related to each value and supply chain will be substantial. A registrant 
may have dozens or even hundreds of suppliers, vendors, and distributors, thereby multiplying 
the amount of data they and their supply and value chain partners would need to obtain.  
 
This is precisely the predicament that would befall many IMA-NA members if the Proposed 
Rule is enacted. Many of our members are small businesses operating in remote areas with 
limited resources and extract or process mineral resources with high input costs and low profit 
 
4 Ibid 
5 40 CFR 98  
6 https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/learn -about -greenhouse -gas-reporting- program -ghgrp  4 margins. Such companies do not possess the resources for the kind of GHG data tracking and 
analysis that their value and supply chain partners that are registrants would be required by the 
Proposed Rule to obtain. 
 Although the Proposed Rule concedes that registrants neither own nor control the equipment 
or operations that emit Scope 3 emissions, it nonetheless suggests that registrants “may influence those activities, for example, by working with its suppliers and downstream distributors to take 
steps to reduce those entities’ Scopes 1 and 2 emissions (and thus help reduce the registrant’s 
Scope 3 emissions) and any attendant risks. As such, a registrant may be able to mitigate the 
challenges of collecting the data required for Scope 3 disclosure.”
7 This argument is an attempt 
to sidestep the reality that the requirement for a registrant to gather such data is not realistically possible. The challenges of collecting data for Scope 3 emissions will not change simply because 
those in a registrant’s value chain produce fewer emissions, particularly given the global and 
multi-faceted nature of many registrants and their markets.  
 Even if reducing emissions would resolve the compliance challenge – which it will not - by 
promoting such a compliance strategy, the Proposed Rule is creating a thinly-veiled GHG reduction requirement for registrants and their value and supply chain partners. There is no other 
logical interpretation for the above-cited portion of the rule that suggests that the way for 
registrants to overcome the challenges of collecting Scope 3 data is to reduce their Scope 3 
emissions. Establishing and/or implementing such an environmental policy goal is well outside 
the bounds of the SEC’s authority and mission. The SEC has neither the resources, the subject 
matter expertise, nor the statutory mission to determine which measures may lead to reduced 
GHG emissions or prescribe those means as de facto requirements for registrants. In addition, the 
fact that the agency that does have such expertise – the EPA – chose not to include Scope 3 in its 
GHG Reporting Program should inform SEC as to both the practicality and materiality of such a requirement and lead the Commission to the conclusion that this requirement is excessively 
impractical and expensive.   
 
In addition, this roundabout method of environmental regulation would effectively reassign 
the responsibility for reducing emissions from an agency-to-company context to a company-to-
company one.  While companies collaborate for a mutually beneficial relationship, task ing one 
company with encouraging a reduction in emissions other companies to achieve regulatory compliance can easily create an unbalanced relationship. Companies should not be implicitly or 
explicitly required to police each other’s emissions. Th at is a role that neither the SEC nor 
companies are equipped or empowered to undertake.   
Further, many IMA-NA members’ operations are not easily transitioned or converted to 
drastically lower emissions. The remote and geographically constrained locations of mineral 
deposits and the high energy output required to extract and process them do not afford our 
members with a variety of lower-emission alternative supply and value chain partners from 
which to choose. Mining trucks, excavators, bulldozers, processing plants, storage facilities, 
kilns, furnaces, conveyors, trains, and other large equipment involved in the mining industry 
require consistent, high levels of energy output that is not currently available in low or zero 
carbon emissions technologies that are economically or commercially viable.  While future 
 
7 87 FR 21377   5 technologies may come to augment or supplement some of those applications, it is currently not 
possible for those in the mining industry to reduce carbon emissions by choosing different supply 
or value chain partners in the manner that the Proposed Rule references.  
 Finally, requiring the disclosure of Scope 3 emissions for registrants who have set GHG 
reductions targets or goals which include Scope 3 emissions may also produce the opposite effect 
the Proposed Rule intends. Given the considerable costs and challenges associated with 
gathering and disclosing Scope 3 emissions, many registrants are likely to refrain from creating 
such a reduction plan at all, and thus disincentivizing them to prioritize lowering emissions 
levels.  
 
The Proposed Rule is an Overlap of Existing Requirements 
 
 As mentioned previously, the Proposed Rule is unnecessary and redundant because existing 
SEC rules and guidance already facilitate the disclosure of climate-related information for 
investors. For example, Item 303 of Regulation S-K, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Conditions and Results of Operations requires disclosure of “material events and 
uncertainties known to management that are reasonably likely to cause reported financial 
information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial 
condition.”
8 Item 101 of Regulation S-K, Description of Business, requires a description of the 
registrant’s business, including each reportable segment,9 including disclosure of the material 
effects that compliance with environmental regulations may have on capital expenditures.10 Item 
103 of Regulation S-K, Legal Proceedings requires a description of material pending legal proceedings, as well as administrative or judicial proceedings relating to the environment under 
specific conditions.
11  Item 105 of Regulation S-K, Risk Factors, also could include climate-
related risks under its broad requirement to discuss the “material factors that make an investment in the registrant or offering speculative or risky.”
12 In totality, these rules enable the disclosure of 
many climate-related risks, factors, and registrants’ responses to them, but with a proper focus on requiring disclosure of information that rises to a proper level of materiality for registrants. 
 Moreover, the SEC issued guidance in 2010 to help registrants apply existing disclosure 
requirements to the context of climate change.
13 From 2010 until 2021, companies regularly 
included climate-related information in SEC filings. The efficacy of this regime is found in the 
fact that the SEC’s own Division of Corporation Finance evaluated those disclosures during 
filing reviews and only rarely issued comment letters relating to unsatisfactory submissions. This 
demonstrates that current disclosure standards rise to the level required by the SEC’s own 
statutes and regulations. In February 2018, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued 
a report on the 2010 guidance which noted that the 2010 requirements represented a significant 
 
8 17 CFR § 229.303(a)  
9 17 CFR § 229.101(c)(1) 
10 17 CFR § 229.101(c)(1)(xii) 
11 17 CFR § 229.103(c)(3) 
12 17 CFR § 229.101(c)(5) 
13 75 FR 6290 (Feb. 8, 2010)  6 step in clarifying climate-related disclosures.14 The report stated that industry groups as well as 
the SEC’s own Investor Advisory Committee found the then-current level of disclosure 
requirement to be adequate. The GAO also cautioned that additional disclosure mandates could 
“have mission and resource implications for the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance.”15 The 
GAO’s report should serve as reassurance that the SEC has taken the necessary steps to provide investors with information regarding registrants’ climate information, as well as a cautionary tale 
against additional regulation like the Proposed Rule.  
 
 Finally, the requirement for disclosing GHG emissions is redundant of the EPA’s 
aforementioned Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The program requires disclosure of Scope 
1 emissions from large GHG emission sources, fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and CO2 
injection sites in the United States.  Emissions defined as Scope 2 under the Proposed Rule are 
also reported to the EPA by the electric utilities which emit them as their own Scope 1 emissions.  
As previously mentioned, those combined requirements equal the Proposed Rule’s disclosure 
requirement for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Information about GHG emissions from these 
sources is available on the EPA’s website and can be searched by several different criteria, 
making it readily accessible to investors and the public. Overall, investors already have access to 
a wealth of climate-related data from SEC filings as well as EPA disclosure requirements, 
thereby rendering the Proposed Rule unnecessary.  
 
The SEC is Using the Proposed Rule to Create De Facto Environmental Regulations That 
are Beyond its Authority 
 
 The Proposed Rule exceeds the SEC’s lawful mission and authority. The SEC’s three-part 
mission – To Protect Investors; To Facilitate Capital Formation; and To Maintain Fair, Orderly and Efficient Markets 
16 – is one inherently focused on ensuring investors can maximize their 
investments for capital and monetary gains. These are goals that Congress has empowered the SEC to pursue, but addressing climate change and reducing GHG emissions are not. To the 
extent that such goals are to be pursued by the federal government, Congress has empowered 
agencies other than the SEC – most notably the EPA – with that mission, and such goals should 
be left to those agencies and the attending subject matter expertise which they possess but the 
SEC lacks.  
 
The Proposed Rule violates this partitioning of authority by not only mandating disclosure 
of climate-related information beyond what is already required, but by also providing – as 
discussed above – recommendations and suggestions for how registrants can lower their carbon 
emissions as well as those in their supply and value chains. Such recommendations are beyond  
the SEC’s statutory authority as well as its practical area of expertise. Congress has neither 
envisioned nor sanctioned the idea that the SEC should be a source of suggested actions for 
reducing GHG emissions or addressing climate change.   
 
 
14 U.S. Government Accountability Office, Climate -Related Risks: SEC Has Taken Steps to Clarify Disclosure 
Requirements (Feb. 2018)  
15 Ibid 
16 https://www.sec.gov/about/what -we-do  7  The argument that the Proposed Rule is necessary because investors and other stakeholders 
desire more climate-related information from companies assumes that the motives for both 
investors desiring such information and the companies already willingly providing it are strictly 
financial or investment-oriented, which is the limit of the SEC’s domain. Many companies 
provide voluntary climate disclosures not because of a material impact on their financial 
situation or viability, but to satisfy demands from environmental and non-governmental 
organizations and other interest groups about the company’s contribution to or mitigation of 
climate change.  
 
Such groups often use that information to either praise a company for attributes or actions 
deemed to address climate change, or to deride, criticize, or even litigate against companies or 
industries whom the interest groups view as actively contributing to climate change. These 
groups may be stakeholders in the issue of environmental or climate policy, but they are not 
necessarily investors who focus on the financial viability of a company in order to maximize 
capital returns. The SEC should not conflate these two things, as it has in the Proposed Rule. 
Considerations of social responsibility or environmental stewardship are in and of themselves 
outside the bounds of the priorities that the SEC is permitted to consider when regulating 
registrants.  
 
As SEC Commissioner Hester  Peirce pointed out in her comments during the March 21, 
2022 meeting about the Proposed Rule, “many calls for enhanced climate disclosure are motivated not by an interest in financial returns from an investment in a particular company, but 
by deep concerns about the climate or, sometimes, superficial concerns expressed to garner 
goodwill.”
17 This places much of the information desired outside the materiality standard by 
which the SEC disclosures are limited. The SEC should focus on requiring disclosure that is actually and directly material to the financial well-being of a company, rather than in satiating 
the desires of political special interests to use the Commission as an indirect means of achieving climate change or environmental objectives by imposing such regulatory requirements on 
registrants.  
 
Gathering Data Needed for Compliance Will Be Time-consuming and Costly for 
Registrants 
 
 The volume and diversity of information required for disclosure under the Proposed Rule 
will make compliance an expensive and time-consuming proposition for many registrants. 
Specifically, the Proposed Rule would require disclosure of information regarding: 
• “The oversight and governance of climate-related risks by the registrant’s board and management;  
• How any climate-related risks identified by the registrant have had or are likely to have a material impact on its business and consolidated financial statements, which may 
manifest over the short-, medium-, or long-term;  
• How any identified climate-related risks have affected or are likely to affect the registrant’s strategy, business model and outlook;  
 
17 https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce -climate -disclosure -20220321# ftn48   8 • The registrant’s processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks 
and whether any such processes are integrated into the registrant’s overall risk 
management system or processes; 
• The impact of climate-related events (severe weather events and other natural conditions 
as well as physical risks identified by the registrant) and transition activities (including 
transition risks identified by the registrant) on the line items of a registrant’s consolidated 
financial statements and related expenditures, and disclosure of financial estimates and 
assumptions impacted by such climate-related events and transition activities. 
• The registrant’s climate-related targets or goals, and transition plan, if any.”18 
 
Compliance would require not only a substantial amount of raw data, but also a considerable 
amount of analysis and assessment, some of which would be quantitative and some that would be qualitative. Such an undertaking would require a considerable amount of specialized equipment, 
personnel, and processes that many companies currently do not possess and which may not be 
readily attainable. The Proposed Rule also requires a blend of both factual measurements of 
current GHG emissions and speculative disclosure of future effects from climate-related risks, 
which again begs the question of how registrants are expected to meet a requirement with such a 
subjective underpinning.  
 In addition, the Proposed Rule requires registrants to disclose the methodologies and metrics 
from which they derive disclosed climate information. This suggests that the SEC will be evaluating the processes and metrics and regulating them accordingly, which in turn raises the 
possibility that registrants’ disclosures could be arbitrarily rejected by the SEC based upon the 
SEC’s disapproval of either the company’s conclusions or the metrics from which they were 
derived. Attempting to satisfy such a requirement will not only be costly for registrants, but for 
SEC staff as well who would be required to take on the additional responsibilities of vetting such 
metrics and conclusions about issues on which SEC staff are not subject matter experts. The SEC 
is neither statutorily permitted nor practical ly capable of undertaking the kind of environmental 
evaluation that the Proposed Rule seeks to impose.  
 
Further, the Proposed Rule requirement of Scope 1, Scope 2, and in some cases, Scope 3 
GHG emissions is complicated by the fact that those emissions are required to be disclosed both in the aggregate and disaggregated by individual greenhouse gases, in addition to disclosing 
them in both absolute and intensity terms. The Proposed Rule would also require accelerated 
filers and large accelerated filers to include attestation reports for Scope 1 and Scope 2 
emissions, and would impose minimum attestation requirement as well as standards for firms 
providing the attestation service.
19 Hiring and retaining such firms would be yet another 
significant cost of compliance for registrants, particularly given that there the demand for attestation services would likely outstrip the supply of firms providing such services should the 
Proposed Rule be finalized. That scarcity would further drive up the cost of attestation, as well as 
likely result in delays for registrants as attestation entities confront a significant backlog of 
requests. Delays in obtaining and receiving service could put registrants at risk of being found to 
be noncompliant with the SEC’s requirements, resulting in possible legal consequences from the

Disclosures for Investors” (“Proposed Rule”),
Attention:

SEC-2022-06342; File No. S7-10-22
Dear Ms. Countryman,
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) 
Proposed Rule, “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures.”
Evergreen Action is writing on behalf of John Kostyack, upon his request and with his 
permission, to submit an article published in Bloomberg Law on September 29, 2022, entitled 
“The Finance Industry Needs Better Climate Disclosures.”
The article, reproduced below, highlights the importance of finalizing the SEC’s climate 
disclosure rule in the wake of the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). As such, we are 
writing to encourage the SEC to finalize this rule and strengthen the scope 3 emissions 
requirements.
The Finance Industry Needs Better Climate Disclosures
By John Kostyack
Secretary Yellen rightly celebrates the Inflation Reduction Act, John Kostyack says, but the law 
shines a light on an urgent problem that she and other regulators must address in the financial 
industry—undisclosed climate risk.
“Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently celebrated the Inflation Reduction Act’s potential to 
drive down climate-damaging pollution, accelerate technology innovation, and reduce energy 
costs for businesses and consumers.
The economic opportunities created by this law are indeed worthy of celebration. But as chair of 
the Financial Stability Oversight Council, Yellen is also obliged to address economic risks 
associated with these dramatic changes.
Hidden RisksLast year, the FSOC
expressed
concerns about the emerging threat of a climate-related 
financial crisis, including transition risks that arise when businesses and financial institutions 
aren’t prepared to shift to a clean energy economy.
Among the top FSOC recommendations was for a Securities and Exchange Commission 
mandate that public companies disclose these risks to their investors. A proposed mandate is 
pending
and expected to be finalized this year.
Financial experts fear that lack of attention to hidden climate risk could lead to a “green swan” 
event, or a sudden and widespread asset deflation that devastates the global economy.
As increasingly ambitious climate laws like the IRA are put in place—and clean energy 
technologies become increasingly available, affordable, and reliable—greater proportions of 
fossil fuel reserves become uneconomic, leaving billions in assets
valueless
and stranded.
Individual savers in the US are uniquely threatened by this poorly disclosed climate risk. A 
recent study
shows they hold $300 billion in high-risk
fossil fuel assets, more than individuals in 
any other country. Even more worrisome, $681 billion of risky fossil fuel assets are on the 
balance sheets of financial institutions—far more than the subprime housing assets that 
triggered the 2008 crisis.
Transparency a Given
Expecting public companies to be transparent with their investor-owners is not controversial. In 
fact, the SEC has been addressing market failures and protecting investors with disclosure rules 
since the 1930s, with little fanfare.
Thus, the five-alarm response of the fossil fuel industry and its allies to the SEC’s climate risk 
disclosure proposal seems bizarre, perhaps leading a casual observer to believe the SEC, not 
Congress, limits the industry’s greenhouse gas emissions.
Just a month before the IRA’s enactment, oil industry leaders filed comments with the SEC 
vehemently opposing its proposal. Ignoring the enthusiastic support expressed by
thousands of 
investors
, the American Petroleum Institute
argued
that climate risk is not a serious investor 
concern.
Dismissing concerns about businesses’ lack of preparedness for the energy transition, it 
claimed, despite powerful
evidence
, that emerging
climate laws can safely be ignored until they 
are implemented.
The
Western Energy Alliance
’s comments on the proposal
symbolize the depth of denialism 
about climate risk in the marketplace and show why the SEC must act now to strengthen its 
regulations. The WEA falsely claims the SEC is “purposefully suppressing American oil and 
natural gas production” for the benefit of Russia, which is allegedly conspiring with US climate 
advocacy groups.
How Disclosures Should Look
In reality, the SEC is not proposing to regulate how or where energy is produced—but instead 
that public companies’ responses to changes in policy, technology, and customer preferences 
spurred by climate change be disclosed in a useful format for investors.If there were ever doubts about whether these changes are meaningful enough to warrant 
investor concern, Congress’s enactment of the IRA has dispelled them—along with the launch 
of similarly ambitious policies this year by California,
Australia
, the
UK
,
and the
European Union
. 
A clean energy revolution is now well underway.
The question facing the SEC is how to provide a disclosure format that enables investors to 
evaluate companies’ preparedness for these changes, and efficiently allocate capital to those 
that are truly prepared. The most important step will be to require standardized and 
comprehensive GHG emissions disclosures.
A particular component of these disclosures will be especially important for investors: Scope 3 
emissions, or the emissions of customers and suppliers, are a critical measure of transition risk 
for many companies.
For example, Scope 3 emissions of oil companies and banks include auto emissions. Thus, 
disclosures would tell investors how exposed these companies are to collapsing demand for 
gasoline due to the IRA’s electric vehicle incentives and EV mandates recently enacted by 
California.
The good news for investors is that the SEC has demonstrated its understanding of these and 
other climate risks and has put forward a strong proposal, with only small adjustments
needed 
to strengthen Scope 3 emissions disclosure requirements.
Once the rule is finalized and climate risks are fully disclosed, climate risk-aware investors will 
be empowered to allocate their dollars to businesses that are taking a thoughtful approach to 
the twin challenges of decarbonization and resilience to climate change impact.
The SEC has no role in promoting this reallocation of capital. Its statutory mandate is to protect 
investors by ensuring they receive consistent and reliable information about the risks that 
threaten the financial condition of public companies.
However, once climate risk information is properly disseminated, the fundamental weaknesses 
of businesses with no meaningful decarbonization strategies will emerge.
With properly functioning capital markets, investment in well-run, climate-smart businesses will 
flourish. This will be good news for investors, the stability of our financial system, and the 
habitability of our planet.”
In conclusion, we encourage the SEC to finalize this rule and strengthen the scope 3 emissions
requirements. Thank you for this opportunity and your consideration.
Best wishes,

Attention:

SEC-2022-06342; File No. S7-10-22
Dear Ms. Countryman,
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) 
Proposed Rule, “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures.” I am 
writing on behalf of
Evergreen Action
and John Kostyak
of Kostyak Strategies. Evergreen Action 
is a national non-profit helping lead the fight to put bold climate action at the top of America’s 
agenda, implement an all-out mobilization to defeat climate change, and create millions of good 
jobs in an equitable clean energy economy.
We commend the SEC’s proposed rule for expanded climate transparency. At the same time, 
we are writing to call upon the SEC to ensure that scope 3 emissions are included in the final 
proposed rule, especially given the new economic and political context of the Inflation Reduction 
Act (IRA).
Accordingly, we would like to submit comments in the form of an article we co-authored with 
John Kostyak and published on October 6, 2022, which outlines the importance of the SEC’s 
climate disclosure rule and the inclusion of scope 3 emissions in the wake of the IRA’s passage.
What Does the Inﬂation Reduction Act Mean for the SEC’s Climate
Disclosure Rule?
By Evergreen and
John Kostyack
Since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued their
climate disclosure
proposal in March 2022,
fossil fuel industry executives
and their allies have launched an
all-out
campaign
to stop this common-sense measure in its
tracks.
The SEC’s proposal would require public companies to disclose their greenhouse gas pollution
and other data regarding the climate-related financial risks they face. Opponents of the rule –
like the
American Petroleum Institute (API
)
and the
same attorneys general who helmed the
West Virginia v. EPA
Supreme Court case
– have spun
a sky-is-falling narrative that
exaggerates the rule’s cost and implementation challenges and denies the reality of climate risk.But each of these narrative ploys are really designed to conceal the weaknesses of their fossil
fuel-centered business model.
In particular, many in the pro-fossil fuel expansion camp have attacked the need to address
“transition risk,” a concept that refers to the economic impact that large-scale changes in clean
energy policies, technologies and customer preferences have on a company’s long-term
profitability. They argue that these dramatic changes are not currently a serious enough risk to
companies’ bottomline and thus have no need to be disclosed to investors.
On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the
Inflation
Reduction Act
(IRA)
into law, injecting
$369 billion in climate investments into the economy. It represented the single largest boost to
clean energy in American history, and an irrefutable economic signal that clean energy is the
way of the future. The rapid scaling of wind, solar, batteries, electrolyzers, and other
technologies driven by this law
will lead to dramatic
cost reductions
. These cost reductions will
create an economic imperative for businesses and consumers around the world to switch to
clean energy technologies. They will also motivate policy makers at the local, state, national and
international levels to enact even more clean energy incentives and mandates.
The IRA is a perfect example of why investors need to know how companies are managing
transition risk. Companies with strong plans for decarbonization will benefit enormously from this
law. Businesses reliant on fossil fuels will likely lose market share. And carbon-intensive
business models lose their dominant status, billions in fossil fuel assets could be stranded,
causing a shock to the financial system. Investors deserve reliable emissions disclosures from
companies so they can assess which are truly prepared for the clean energy transition.
To understand transition risk, investors need a full picture of a company’s emissions. And this
picture cannot be complete without “Scope 3 emissions,” or the emissions of customers and
suppliers,
which
account for the largest share of
most companies’ greenhouse gas emissions.
The SEC’s statutory mandate is to protect investors by making sure companies disclose how
prepared they are for major market shifts, like the transition to clean energy. Now, the U.S.
government has just supercharged this transition with the passage of the IRA. That’s why the
SEC’s climate disclosure rule must be strengthened to
require
companies to disclose
all of their
emissions.
President Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and Securities & Exchange Commission
(SEC) Chair Gary Gensler must act to mitigate climate-driven risks to the economy. That effort
should include SEC promulgating a strong climate disclosure rule that includes mandatory
disclosure of Scope 3 emissions.
The good news is that the SEC’s proposal would require public companies to disclose some of
their greenhouse gas emissions to investors. The bad news is that it does not require
all
of their
emissions to be disclosed. The proposal requires the disclosure of “Scope 1 emissions,” which acompany creates in its own operations, as well as “Scope 2 emissions,” which come from the
generation of purchased energy. Scope 3 emissions, however, which are all other emissions
associated with a company’s activities, are almost entirely left up to each company’s discretion
to disclose. In short, under the proposal, unless you are a company that has set a target for
reducing Scope 3 emissions, disclosing Scope 3 emissions is essentially voluntary.
That’s a major problem for investors trying to understand a company’s transition risk because
for most companies,
most of their emissions are Scope
3 emissions
. In fact,
CDP estimated
that
Scope 3 emissions account for roughly 75% of greenhouse gas emissions in sectors important
to the energy transition. That means investors will be left in the dark about the bulk of most
companies’ emissions, and can’t properly evaluate how vulnerable their supply chain and
customer base is to transition risk.
What would it look like for the IRA to impact a company with high Scope 3 emissions? It’s
relatively straightforward that an oil company, with high Scope 3 emissions from the burning of
oil to drive a car, would be exposed to declining demand for gas-powered cars due to the IRA’s
electric vehicle incentives. But other companies’ level of Scope 3 emissions are not so easy to
predict. Manufacturing companies, for instance, can have varying levels of upstream emissions
from their suppliers, and thus their exposure to emissions regulations would be harder for an
investor to assess.
It is crystal clear that the IRA and future climate legislation will have dramatic impacts on the
economy, and that the narrative pushed by fossil fuel lobbyists that this is not a concern for
today’s investors is not only wrong, but reckless. Transition risk is a real and present
transparency oversight and unless investors are given the information they need to intelligently
allocate capital, could result in a climate-fueled economic crash.
In the wake of the IRA’s passage, the SEC must strengthen the climate risk proposed rule to
include the mandatory disclosure of Scope 3 emissions and finalize it immediately.”
*

*
In conclusion, Evergreen Action respectfully urges the SEC to strengthen the proposed rule by
requiring disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions for all registrants, with reasonable assurance
obtained. The SEC should not permit companies to self-determine if their Scope 3 emissions
are “material,” as currently proposed by the rule.
Thank you for this opportunity and your consideration.
Best wishes,
Mattea Mrkusic

In this comment set forth below, we will discuss three topics::

1. Mr. Biden and Global Warming Policy Hypocrisy.
2. Anthropogenic CO2 Global Warming is Junk Science.
3. An Alternative Simplified Global Warming Disclosure Regulation.

1. Mr. Biden and his Global Warming Policy hypocrisy

This comment refers to Mr. Biden.

The 2020 presidential election was rife with rampant illegal fraudulent votes for
Democrat Candidate Joe Biden. The movie \""2000 Mules\"" documents tens of thousands of
illegally harvested votes for Joe Biden in key swing states. In a deplorable
repudiation of our democracy, dozens of courts have thrown out citizen's lawsuits
demanding investigations of election fraud. Citizen's lawsuits were thrown out due
to standing, meaning that regardless of the evidence of election fraud, citizens
have no right to question the election result.

For example, Joe Biden narrowly won Georgia by a margin of 0.23% and 11,779 votes.
Six Fulton County counting room whistleblowers signed affidavits under oath
documenting 30,000 fake ballots for Joe Biden and the two democrat U.S. Senate
candidates.  Fake appearing ballots were pristine with no folds and appeared to
have toner, not pen, filled bubbles.  Toner in the bubble is easy to test and
would be irrefutable proof of a fake ballot. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation
is politically compromised and refused to fully investigate the ballots.
Citizens sued to have the ballots tested.

Fulton County Elections officials did not want the ballots tested, badly. What
are they hiding? Fulton County Elections officials hired very expensive top
private criminal defense attorneys, Garland, Samuel  Loeb, PC to fight the
suit to investigate the ballots.  The top partner, Donald Samuel fought the
case in court. The Georgia Court of Appeals dismissed the case due to standing.
The court basically ruled that citizen whistleblowers have no say on election
fraud.  The ballots remain under seal.  Until these ballots are examined by a
credible investigator, we do not know who won the presidential election in
Georgia.  We do not know if the two democrat Georgia senators were duly elected.

Arizona counted 19,000 ballots submitted a day late on November 4th.

The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are
politically compromised and refused to investigate the 2020 presidential
election fraud.

With election perfidy investigations blocked by democrat politicians,
compromised agencies, and feckless judges, we just don't know if Joe Biden
was duly elected president. We don't know if the two senators from Georgia
were duly elected. The failure to ensure and unwillingness to verify a fair
2020 election has imperiled our democracy.  What is our democracy if elections
can not be trusted?

The \""Big Lie\"" might be that the \""Big Lie\"" is not a \""Big Lie\"".

The disputed 2020 election has had a huge affect on Federal Global Warming policies.

As soon as Mr. Biden, a qua climatologist, took office, a locust swarm of Global Warming
Alarmists infested the Biden administration.  Candidate Joe Biden's campaign promise was
to solve The Global Warming Crisis while at the same time creating millions of \""good
paying union jobs\"".

Mr. Biden's hypocritical and wasteful Global Warming policies are an enormous deadweight
loss on the U.S. economy, costing jobs, costing taxpayers, and costing people's lives.

On day one Global Warming Alarmists hornswoggled a befuddled Mr. Biden into canceling
the permit for the Keystone Pipeline, throwing 10,000 workers out of work.  A nasty
surprise for the hapless Pipefitters Union, which had endorsed Candidate Joe Biden.

Mr. Biden has increased the CAFE fuel economy mandates for cars and trucks.
Studies have shown CAFE mandated small cars kill about 2,000 Americans per year.
To help sell more small cars I propose a federal incentive programme for small car buyers:
\""The Fuel Efficient Car Crash Corpse Closed Casket Funeral Entitlement\"", known by the
acronym \""FEFE\"".  FEFE pays for closed casket funerals for these lost lives, that have been
sacrificed to save gas and save the planet.  If you go in a Yugo, or are dying in a Scion,
or left us in a Tesla, FEFE has you covered.

Mr. Biden's hypocrisy was on full display with his comical 21-car motorcade
to the November 2021 COP26 Global Warming Conference in Glasgow.  The 21-car motorcade
was a cutback from Mr. Bidens enormous 85-vehicle motorcade in Rome for his visit with
Pope Francis.  Many of these vehicles were flown across the Atlantic Ocean in
kerosene-guzzling Air Force One and other air transports. Like Mr. Biden, Pope Francis
has become a qua climatologist, pontificating that \""we have no time to wait\"" on climate
change.

If Mr. Biden was sincere about substituting renewable energy for fossil fuels he would do
everything and anything to minimize the costs of renewables.  Instead, he touts creating
millions of \""good paying union jobs\"", payback for union campaign money.  More hypocrisy
is evident in Mr. Biden's policies that needlessly increase costs of renewables or waste
fossil fuels, thereby exacerbating the Global Warming Crisis:

A. China is the low-cost producer of solar panels by a significant margin.  Cheap Chinese
subsidized solar panels are a magnanimous gift from China to the world to accelerate
renewable energy.  Unfortunately, starting with Nobel Prize winner President Obama,
tariffs have been charged significantly increasing the cost of Chinese Solar panels for
U.S. buyers.  Mr. Biden has kept Obama's solar panel tariffs.

B. A small California solar panel company, Auxin Solar, complained that cheap Chinese
Solar panels were being shipped through other Asian countries to avoid the tariffs.  In
response, Mr. Biden's tariff regulators have shut down solar panel imports from all over
Asia while the trade complaint is investigated.  This regulatory kerfuffle and import
ban have thrown the whole U.S. solar industry into chaos.

C. Starting with the Trump Administration, U.S. offshore wind power farms are finally
being approved.  A 1920 cabotage law, the Jones Act, mandates expensive U.S. flagged
ships between U.S. ports.  Mr. Biden has extended the Jones Act to mandate expensive
U.S. flagged Jones Act supply ships for U.S. offshore wind farms.  For Mr. Biden, \""good
paying union jobs\"" on ridiculously expensive U.S. flagged ships are more important than low-cost offshore wind power.

D. The Federal Government's answer to its needlessly increased costs of renewables was
designed many years ago by squadrons of expensive K-Street lobbyists.  Massive subsidies
of $23 per MWH are paid to renewable power producers.  These subsidies were initiated
in 1999 to accelerate renewable development.  Lobbyists promised to end subsidies when
renewables reached full development, so the subsidies expired every few years.  They
have been extended 13 times.  Every few years squadrons of expensive K-Street lobbyists
infest Congress and the Department of Energy like hooked heroin addicts begging for
extended subsidies.  Squadrons of expensive K-Street lobbyists cleverly designed a
lifetime career path for themselves of periodically begging Congress and the DOE for
extending federal energy subsidies.

Wind subsidies are so high that unneeded wind power is frequently sold at negative prices.
When power demand is low, grid operators are paid as much as $20 per MWH by wind farms to
take away unneeded wind power so wind farms can capture the $23 per MWH federal subsidy.

E. Mr. Biden wants to spend $66 billion on upgrading Amtrak.  Every time I see a
nearly empty Amtrak train thundering up the 6,887 ft Donner Pass, climbing the grade,
hauling a string of heavy railroad cars, exhaust stacks blasting into the mountain air,
I wonder about this colossal waste of diesel fuel.  And Mr. Biden wants more of that.
Amtrak is Exhibit A of Mr. Biden's \""good paying union jobs\"", regardless of economic
sense, and regardless of environmental impact. Somebody has to do a study of Amtrak's
horrendous diesel fuel consumption and CO2 footprint per passenger mile.

F. The 400lb gorilla in electric power generation is nuclear, at 19% of U.S production.
Nuclear power is the most obvious solution for reducing fossil fuel burning.  Nuclear
power plants do not emit any CO2, and radiation has never killed anyone in the U.S.A.
Modern modular designs are very safe.  Spent nuclear fuel could be recycled with very
little waste if not for the 1980's ban on fuel recycling inspired by 13-year-old Amy
Carter. Mr. Biden and another politically ambitious qua climatologist, California
Governor Gavin Newsom, doesn't want to extend nuclear power plant licenses, letting
them expire instead, thereby forcing these zero CO2 emissions plants to close.  At
least five nuclear power plant license extensions are currently in jeopardy at the
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Global Warming Alarmists' quixotic rejection of nuclear power tells you all you
need to know about their real hidden agenda.  Global Warming Alarmist's policy agenda
always insists on big expensive government programmes for \""climate change\"" but
the real goal is income and wealth redistribution.  The Global Warming Crisis is a
convenient vehicle for forcing less freedom, more tax slavery, bigger government,
more regulations, and ultimately income and wealth redistribution.

The disputed 2020 election has also affected the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Chairman, democrat Gary Gensler, was appointed by Mr. Biden and approved by the
Senate.  Democrat Commissioner Allison Lee has been a strong advocate of climate
change disclosure regulations but is leaving the Commission.  Her replacement,
which must be approved by the Democratic Senate, will certainly be a democrat, who
will most certainly continue with these climate change disclosure regulations.

In addition to Commission leadership, it is quite clear that Global Warming Alarmists
have also infested the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  And they
have been very very busy.  The SEC has released the Climate Kraken: File Number
S7-10-22, Release Nos. 33-11042 34-94478, The Enhancement and Standardization of
Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors.  This sea monster of regulations
measures a brobdingnagian 490 pages

2. Anthropogenic CO2 Global Warming is Junk Science.

A. Global Warming Data Fraud.

Global Warming Alarmists have used lies and doctored data for decades to promote
their policy agendas toward income and wealth redistribution.

Global Warming Alarmists' perfidy was rampant in the infamous ClimateGate scandal.
Leading global warming climatologists were caught fraudulently doctoring temperature
data to increase Global Warming. The United Nations Nobel prize-winning Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) used temperature data from East Anglia University's
Keith \""Fudge Factor\"" Briffa whose computer code contained what he called \""fudge
factors\"" adding up to 0.75 of a degree to increase the recent temperature data. In
addition, climate scientists conspired to expunge the high historic temperatures
of the Medieval Warming Period.  In the MWP the Earth was so warm that Greenland was
actually green.  Deleting the MWP made the current warming look unique.  It is not.
Furthermore, Pennsylvania State University Prof. Michael \""Hide the Decline\""
Mann fraudulently spliced two temperature data sets. To make them match he raised
the lower data set to match the higher data set where they overlapped. This hid a
discrepancy that would have shown up as declining temperatures. Prof. Mann was
nearly fired for this breach of the academic research protocol.

The ClimateGate Scandal showed there is an abundance of man-made global warming data.
But not so much man-made global warming.  Like the made-up temperature data, Nobel
Prize winner President Obama made up a number when he said \""97 percent of climate
scientists agree that climate change is real, man-made and dangerous.\""

In fact, there are a lot of respected scientists that disagree, and probably many more
that silently disagree.  What we have here is an Asch conformity syndrome.  Pressure
from a group leads people to conform, even when they know that the rest of the group
is wrong.  Pressure is endemic.  The academic peer review process has been corrupted.
It's a lynch mob. Doubting scientists can't get research grants, can't get their
research published, and don't get hired for climate policy jobs. Among academia,
these \""Climate Deniers\"" are one cut above a leper with a bell.

B. Proof that Man Made CO2 Has Not Warmed the Earth.

The science is not settled. Blaming man-made Carbon Dioxide, CO2 molecules, for The
Global Warming Crisis is junk science.

We can agree that the Earth has warmed by about +1.0C degree during the Industrial era.
We can also agree that CO2 has increased +0.013% from 0.028% of the atmosphere to
0.041% during the Industrial era.  However, correlation does not prove causality.

CO2 is a tiny trace gas.  Envision this: If you are in a room with a 9 ft ceiling
and all the gasses were stacked, the pre-industrial CO2 layer would be as thin as
a credit card.  The raised letters on the credit card are as tall as all the extra
CO2 added during the industrial age.  It is this tiny thin layer of an invisible gas
that has got potty mouth Greta Thunberg, Nobel Prize winner Al Gore, befuddled
Mr. Biden, and all the other Global Warming alarmists panties in a bunch.  An
invisible layer of gas as thin as the raised letters on a credit card.

How an infinitesimal +0.013% increase in CO2 can cause a +1.0C degree increase in
the remaining 99.987% of the atmosphere defies any explanation.

The Global Warming - CO2 gas math is quite simple. And physically impossible.
The Earth's atmosphere has warmed +1.0C degrees during the industrial era.  The
added CO2 during the industrial era is one part in 7,700 of the atmosphere.
To heat the atmosphere +1.0C degrees, the added CO2 molecules must contribute
+1.0C x 7,700 or +7,700C degrees of heat.  The surface of the Sun, 93 million
miles away, is 5,700C degrees.  It defies common sense, and physics, that the
Sun's surface heat, at 5,700C degrees, can travel 93 million miles through space
and then heat Earth's CO2 molecules hotter than the Sun at 7,700C degrees.

To make the CO2 heat pencil out, Global Warming Alarmists claim there is a CO2
greenhouse heat feedback effect which amplifies the Sun's warming, a gimmick
with the fancy name of \""Radiative Forcing\"". The extra heat is impossible.
CO2 can't add more heat than it absorbs. CO2 is an inert gas.  There is no
exothermic chemical reaction.

The planet Venus has been hailed by climate scientists as an example of CO2
caused Global Warming.  Yes, Venus is very hot, 460C degrees.  But conditions on
Venus are extreme.  The dense atmosphere is 96.5% CO2.  Surface air pressure
is 1,300 Pounds per square inch, equal to 93 Earth atmospheres.  That amounts
to 220,000 times as much CO2 as the Earth. Plus, at 67 million miles from the
Sun, Venus receives twice the sunlight energy per square meter as the Earth.
The extreme CO2 density, high pressure, and strong sunlight conditions combine
to make the Venus CO2 warming effect 4.1 million times greater than the
Earth's CO2.

Man-made CO2 molecules are not the control knob for the Earth's temperature.

Don't be hornswoggled by Global Warming Alarmists.  It's junk science

3. An Alternative Simplified Global Warming Disclosure Regulation.

You gotta wonder who wrote this massive inscrutable 490-page proposed regulation?
Answer: Expensive K-Street lobbyists, expensive accounting and consulting firms
eager to get hired to help companies comply, lawyers eager for all the resulting
lawsuits, and the nameless faceless Global Warming Alarmists bureaucrats that have
infested the Securities and Exchange Commission.  It is 490 pages of dreadful hooey
that only a $450 per hour environmental consultant lawyer could love.

If this thing passes, you gotta feel sorry for the hapless public companies, SEC
registrants, having to comply with yet another onerous SEC filing, frivolously
thickening their Registration filings and 10-Ks at a costly expense.  CFOs reminisce
on their halcyon days as a private company when there was no such SEC compliance
nonsense.

I propose an Alternative Simplified Global Warming Disclosure Regulation.

Have each SEC filing company disclose a simple estimate quantifying how much their
end-use CO2 emissions will increase the Earth's temperature.  As Hillary Clinton
once said: \""What difference does it make?\""

While I disagree that man-made CO2 has any significant effect on the Earth's
temperature, to make the Global Warming Alarmists at the SEC happy we will go with it.

With very little effort, without expensive outside advisors, using high school arithmetic, SEC filing companies
can make a ballpark estimate of their future end-use CO2 emissions over the
next 20 years.  A good faith ballpark estimate of the number of Metric tonnes of CO2
is all that is needed.  A good faith ballpark estimate should be deemed \""safe harbor\""
lawsuit proof to keep vulture shareholder class action lawsuit lawyers out.

About 2.3 trillion tonnes of CO2 have been emitted during the industrial era.  The global
temperature has increased +1.0C degree.  Using this ratio, each company's temperature
impact can be quantified:

EARTH TEMPERATURE IMPACT = COMPANY END USE C02 TONNES X 1.0C / 2,300,000,000,000

For example, a trucking company estimates it will burn 5,000,000 gallons of diesel
fuel in the next 20 years. A gallon of diesel emits 28.38 pounds of CO2, or 64,365
tonnes over 20 years.  The Earth's global warming temperature increase from this
company is, therefore, 0.0000000280C degrees.

0.0000000280C = 64,364 X 1.0C / 2,300,000,000,000

That's it.  Just a couple of sentences in the 10-K quantifying the bottom line.

If the SEC and Global Warming Alarmists sincerely care solely about corporate
contributions to The Global Warming Crisis, this tells them all they need to know.
Global Warming Alarmists can add up all the temperature filings to quantify the
total contribution of SEC filing companies to The Global Warming Crisis.

In summary, what we have here is a President and Senate that may have been fraudulently
elected, infested the federal government with Global Warming Alarmists, using a global
warming theory tainted with fraudulent junk science, to force-feed wasteful Global
Warming policies that are a massive deadweight loss on the U.S. economy, costing jobs,
costing taxpayers, costing people's lives, and in addition, appointing SEC officials
proposing this 490-page monstrosity of utterly useless global warming regulations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Re: RIN 3235 –AM87 , The Enhancement and Standardization  of Climate -Related 
Disclosures for  Investors  
Dear Chair Gensler,  
On behalf of the team members  of AMERCO and the U -Haul system 
(NASDAQ - UHAL1), I provide this response to your request for comment on  the SEC’s 
new proposed rule  on climate -related risk disclosures.   
Now  the largest truck -sharing company in North America , U-Haul was started 
in 1945 by my mother and father as they returned from military service.  U-Haul 
remains family managed today , and we view the communities we operate in as 
partners in our business . As U -Haul approaches a community, that partnership 
enabl es us  to collaborate to reduce vehicle registrations and greenhouse gas 
emissions. We have  pioneered starch -based packing peanuts, permeable ground 
cover, cardboard -box reuse, moving pads from discarded fabrics, reuse of obsolete 
buildings , improved  fuel economy, and a long list of  other award -winning sustainable 
business practices.  
U-Haul defines  itself as being in the shared -use business. The sharing model  
itself is one of good stewardship  and careful management of the Earth's resources, 
while  makin g these resources readily available to more of the Earth's inhabitants. 
Done well, our sharing model  enhance s sustainability.   
It is in the light of this  commitment to sustainability that I write  this letter. 
U-Haul  believes that our commitment to environm ental stewardship and a reduc tion 
of our greenhouse gas emission s is part of our  duty . But the  climate -related  risk 
disclosures called for in the proposed rule are impractical, illegal, and 
unconstitutional.  
 
 
 
1 AMERCO has two Board members certified as a Certified Director of the National Association 
of Corporate  Directors —AMERCO is the first public company to have 2 Directors receive this 
distinction.  2 
 The Proposed Rule is Duplicative of U -Haul ’s Already Substantial Obligations Under 
Federal, State, and Local Environmental Laws  
Compliance with environmental requirements —federal, state, and local —is 
already a significant part of U -Haul ’s business.  
As required by current SEC regulations, U -Haul already discloses material 
climate - and environment -related risks in its annual shareholder disclosures, 
including statements that U -Haul complies with existing environmental laws and 
regulations, while acknow ledging that those laws and regulations may change.  
Those existing  requirements hold U-Haul  to strict standards for clean air, 
clean water, and clean land.   
For example, o ur truck and trailer rental business  is held to strict standards 
of vehicle emissions —including greenhouse gas emissions , by the Environmental 
Protection Agency. EPA has recently proposed updated light -duty vehicle and heavy -
duty vehicle rules , tightening restrictions on nitrous oxi des (NOx)  and on greenhouse 
gases .2 This is part of  EPA ’s aggressive plan that is  “charting a path to advance zero -
emission vehicles ” in the American automotive fleet.3  
In California and in the 15 other states  that have adopted California ’s 
standards , our vehicles meet the even more stringent requirements of  the California 
Air Resources Board (CARB) . CARB ’s light -duty vehicle and heavy -duty vehicle  rules  
have  set aggressive standards that we work to comply with . 
In addition, our storage business is also  subject to federal, state, and local laws  
and regulations relating to environmental protection.  These regulations limit 
discharge into the air, water, and land and require us to undertake remediation 
projects fo r contaminated land.  
This web of regulations  serves as a backstop to clima te-related risk that our 
investor s can be assured we are meeting. There  are risks associated with a changing 
climate and a changing regulatory environment. But when  these  risks  are material, 
we are already required to disclose them. And we do.   
Policy Bene fits of Principles -Based Approach  
As I mentioned in my June  2021 comment letter, t he SEC has considered and 
rejected calls to create mandatory prescriptive  disclosure standards  and instead 
 
2 See EPA Proposes Stronger Standards for Heavy -Duty Vehicles to Promote Clean Air, Protect 
Communities, and Support Transition to Zero -Emissions Future , EPA (Mar. 7, 2022),

 preferred  S-K disclosure  to employ a  principles -based  approach. Rather than  
prescriptive standards, which employ a one-size-fits-all approach to  disclosure, a 
principles -based approach “provide[s] registrants with the flexibility to determine (i)  
whether certain information is material, and (ii) how to disclose such infor mation. ”4  
This principles -based approach filters out immaterial information that would 
dilute  material disclosures and make it harder  for investors to make decisions.5 
Additionally, the principles -based system “elicit[s] disclosure that is more in line with 
the way the registrant ’s management and its board of directors monitor and assess 
the business, and therefore (1) would be easier for registrants to prepare using 
existing metrics and  reporting mechanisms and (2) would provide investors better 
insight into the decision -making  process, current status, and prospects of the 
registrant. ”6  
A prescriptive  one-size-fits-all approach prevents  the organic  development of 
materiality standards to fit changing circumstances and market preferences. This  is 
exactly why the SEC has refused to issue prescriptive standards  in the past : “The 
Business Roundtable cites  100 times the SEC failed to include societal issues as 
material, arguing, ‘[I]t is impossible to  provide every item of information that might 
be of i nterest to some investor in making investment  and voting decisions. ’”7 
A principles -based  approach is particularly well suited to climate -related risk  
disclosures because “the relevant info rmation tends to vary greatly across companies ” 
and “the more stan dardized prescriptive requirements are less likely to elicit 
information that is tailored  to a specific company. ”8 Greenhouse  gas emissions are a 
perfect example of how  the “relevant i nformation ” varies greatly between companies. 
While a rise in Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions for  a technology 
company may be evidence of increasing environmental impac t, the same rise may be 
evidence of decreasing environmental impact when coming from a ren tal business

 like U -Haul. That is bec ause each rental  from  U-Haul displaces  emissions that could 
come from another source. For example, because U -Haul has moving trucks available 
to rent , individuals and small businesses are less likely to  purchase and regularly 
drive a large truck whose haul ing capacity they need only occasionally . Instead, they 
purchase a smaller vehicle for daily use and then rent a large truck  only when they 
need it. The result is a colossal reduc tion in  greenhouse gas emissions , but that reality 
is not captured in  the pro posed rule.  
It makes no sense to carve out climate -related risk disclosures  for a  
prescriptive approach , and the SEC has not provided the necessary justification for 
this choice.  In the list of “reasonable alternative[] ” proposals, the proposed rule  does 
not even  acknowledge the possibility of maintaining the current principles -based 
materiality requirement.9 Under the current principles -based approach , the S EC and 
private parties ha ve a right of action to pursue relief when companies breach the 
existing disclosure requirements, including because of omitted or misstated climate -
related  risk information. The proposed rule does not explain why these robust 
enforcement mechanisms have proven inadequate in ensuring that companies 
provide climate informat ion, especially because  the SEC itself could bring 
enforcement actions if it honestly believed that companies were not disclosing 
material climate information.   
The proposed rule argues that uniform , mandatory  disclosures will necessarily 
aid stakeholders,  but, as discussed next, it sets the bar for disclosure  so low  that it 
will actually just bury investors in an avalanche of trivial information , making it 
harder to find the climate -related information that is actually relevant to a company ’s 
performance.  
The Proposed Rule Will Confuse Investors and Obfuscate U -Haul ’s Industry -Leading 
Innovations  
Any regulatory regime must incorporate careful consideration of how tight the 
controls should be in promoting consistency and accountability without compromising 
the regulatory benefits of promoting flexibility and innovation, the key driver of long -
term economic growth of the United States .10 
U-Haul has long been an industry innovator  in maximizing efficiency and 
avoiding waste. But by requiring a one -size-fits-all framework rather than a 
principles -based framework, the proposed rule will penalize companies like U -Haul 
that have long created difficult -to-quantify , but real  environmenta l benefits , and will

UNREASONABLENESS (1982).   5 
 also mislead investors by giving erroneous impressions about the actual 
environmental impact of peer companies.  For example:  
• U-Haul rental trucks have long used a low profile, rounded corners , and 
advanced chassis skirts to reduce win d drag and improve fuel economy by up 
to 20% , and f uel economy gauges are installed in every new -production truck 
to provide real -time feedback to drivers to optimize fuel consumption.  Most of 
our U -Haul locations are built with e nergy -efficient lighting, HVAC systems, 
and daylighting,  saving  more than 42,000,000 kWh every year . Many of our 
locations also take part in permeable ground cover initiatives, reducing 
stormwater run -off, recharging the ground water supply, and reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions by  limiting local heat islands and significantly 
reducing energy expended in water treatment. But many of our competitors 
have not utilized these mechanisms, meaning they can adopt them in the 
future and give a faux appearance of dramatically “improving ” their footprint , 
which may mislead investment decisions.  The metrics will not actually help 
comparability for investors since U -Haul ’s rental share model  is unique.  
 
• U-Haul has a fleet of thousands of vehicles, but that large number of vehicles 
reduces global emissions  because , in our business analysis , a truck available 
for short -term rental in a neighborhood will eliminate the equiva lent of 
nineteen high -capacity vehicles (such as full -size pickup trucks or SUVs) from 
being registered over a ten -year period. But the proposed rule provides no 
means by which U -Haul can present this incredible  greenhouse gas reduction  
in any sort of indu stry-comparable manner.  
 
• U-Haul rental trailers are the single most fuel -efficient way to transport goods 
with a private -owned vehicle because they greatly expand carrying capacity 
while imposing only modest and temporary decreases in the tow-vehicle ’s own 
fuel economy.  But the proposed rule is unclear about how U -Haul can account 
for the savings of using a trailer versus the alternative of customers making 
repeat trips in their own vehicles . And that is even assuming U -Haul could 
somehow c alculate this exact figure, which itself presents considerable 
difficulties.  
 
• Relatedly, all U -Haul rental trucks have the ability to tow another vehicle —
an option utilized by approximately one -third  of our customers —thereby 
reducing emissions by eliminati ng the need to separately  drive  a personal 
vehicle during a move. But again, it is difficult to imagine how U -Haul can 
quantify these savings for purposes of the proposed rule . 
 6 
 • U-Haul has more than 23,200  locations . That vast number of locations actually 
reduces emissions , by allowing  customers to drive less distance  to find a rental 
truck or trailer, and then drive less distance to return it when finished . Again, 
it is exceedingly difficult to determine precisely how much fuel this saves, 
making it difficult for U -Haul to include any such estimate in a forthcoming 
report pursuant to the proposed rule.  
 
• U-Haul rental trucks typically last seven to twelve years before replacement, 
compared to 1.5 years on a verage for rental car companies ’ equipment  and 4 
years for rental truck “peers” . Rental car companies will  periodically purchas e 
electric and fuel -efficient vehicles , giving the impression of using efficient 
technology. But that ignores the tremendous environmental consequences of 
manufacturing all of those new cars  and replac ing them  every 18 months. 
Those harms are far greater than using a  perhaps  slightly -less-efficient vehicle 
for far longer, as U -Haul does. Again, the proposed rule provides no meaningf ul 
way for U -Haul to capture the environmental savings of using vehicles for  a 
decade rather than frequently replacing them with electric vehicles.  And 
investors will be misled by the apparent “green ” nature of companies that, in 
reality, just buy new vehicles every 18 -48 months.  
 
• Given the present realities of long -distance moving , U-Haul has no electric -
vehicle solution for most transactions. Customers often drive lengthy distances 
using our equipment, making it ill -suited for range -limited electric vehic les. 
Thus, the proposed rule will give the false impression that U -Haul ’s vehicles 
are not “trending green, ” whereas in reality U -Haul has long been a leader in 
this area but is limited by the inherent nature of long -distance moving  and 
available technolog y11. 
 
• U-Haul also has a pioneering renewable propane initiative: providing propane 
derived from renewable sources like grease residue and biomass feedstocks to 
deliver lower carbon options to our customers. While this product comes at a 
premium price, we have chosen to absorb th e cost so our customers will benefit 
the environment at no additional charge.  But again, the proposed rule provides 
no obvious framework for recognizing the benefits of a program like this.  In 
fact, this proposed rule penalizes comp anies such as U -Haul  to expand or even 
sustain their current operations.  
 
11 See DOE Announces Nearly $200 Million to Reduce Emissions Trucks from Cars and Trucks, 
November 1, 2021, Dept. of Energy.  7 
 By insisting on imposing a one -size-fits-all framework, the proposed rule suffers from 
dramatic over- and under -inclusiveness. Not only does this penalize companies like 
U-Haul that y ield tremendous environmental benefits that are nonetheless difficult 
to measure, but it also misleads investors by giving the false impression that certain 
companies, even within the same industry, are “greener ” than others.  While 
measurements will appear  comparable, further study will lead to misleading 
investors.  
The Proposed Climate -Related Risk Disclosures  Transgress the Supreme Court's 
Interpretation of “Materiality ” 
The proposed rule suffers from other significant flaws , including transgressing 
Supre me Court precedent . SEC Rule 405 sets out the definition of materiality for 
purposes of Regulation S -K: “The term material, when used to qualify a requirement 
for the furnishing of information as to any  subject, limits the information required to 
those mat ters to which there is a substantial likelihood  that a reasonable investor 
would attach importance in determining whether to purchase the security  
registered. ”12 This definition reflects the Supreme Court's interpretation of  
“material ”: “[T]here must be a substantial likelihood that the  disclosure of the omitted 
fact would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having  significantly 
altered the 'total mix' of information made available. ”13 The Court explains that  the 
“public interest ” is not furthered by requiring companies “simply to bury the 
shareholders in an avalanche of trivial information, ” which “is hardly conducive to 
informed decision -making ” and thus would “accomplish more harm than good. ”14 
Under the principles -based approach, regulated entities use this  definition to 
determine case-by-case whether a “reasonable investor ” would consider the  disclosure 
relevant. As the SEC acknowledges, this is information that a company must already 
disclose.15  
But th e proposed rule requires complex, expansive , and speculative disclosures 
far beyond what are required by the current materiality standard.16 The proposed 
rule requires Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions data from registrants despite seem ingly  
acknowledg ing that those  emissions are not material for all  registrants. At most, the 
proposed rule says only that such emissions “may” face “declines in cash flows ” and 
thus in vestors “may” want Scope 1 and Scope 2 information.17 The proposed rule

 suggests that  there might be “future regulations ” that “may” require reductions in 
emissions, and thus this information might be material in this hypothetical future 
world.18 The propo sed prescriptive approach would fundamentally shift  the focus of 
disclosures from a “reasonable investor ” to a one-size-fits-all requirement that  
provides all information that may be important to someone in a hypothetical future .19 
This seems  to be exactly  the “avalanche of trivial information ” that Supreme Court 
warned of.20  
Even for data that must be disclosed only when “material, ” it is clear that the 
proposed rule has diluted the meaning of materiality .21 For instance, Scope 3 
emissions must be disclosed only when material, but the proposed rule suggests that 
such disclosures  are generally material, and any doubts  must “be resolved in favor 
of” over-disclosure.22 But given that Scope 3 emissions are not under the direct control 
of the registrant, it is difficult to see how they can be material —let alone 
presumptively material —to that registrant ’s financial performance . 
The Proposed Climate -related Risk Disclosures  are Arbitrary and Capricious  
The proposed rule would also be arbitrary and capricious  for a variety of 
reasons .  
First , the  proposed rule  is internally inconsistent  because it  mandates the 
disclosure of information that it acknowledges are highly speculative and will not be 
useful  to a reasonable investor. The proposed rule acknowledges that  climate -related  
risks are very difficult  to calculate accurately because of the “uncertainty and 
complexity of climate -related risks and the multidimensional nature of the 
information being disc losed, ” which can manifest themselves over decades.23 This 
uncertainty means that much of the required  disclosure s will be guesswork  and, as 
the rule acknowledges, there is no “predictable investor response[] ” to such 
speculative disclosures.24 Still, the  proposed rule concludes that the solution  is to 
 
18 Id. at 21,435.  
19 See Matrixx  Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano , 563 U.S. 27, 30 –31 (2011) ( “We conclude that the 
materiality of adverse event reports cannot be reduced to a bright -line rule. Although in many cases 
reasonable investors would not consider reports of adverse events to be material information, 
respondents have alleged facts plausibly suggesting that reasonable investors would have viewed 
these particular reports as material. ”); see also  Chandler Crenshaw, supra  at 298  (“Similar to the risk 
factors test, the SEC needs to foc us more on fact -based inquiries as opposed to introducing a blanket 
rule in order to survive judicial scrutiny. ”).

 mandate the disclosure of such information.25 This is internally inconsistent and 
illogical and thus arbitrary and capricious.  
Second , the proposed rule does not j ustify its break with longstanding policy 
and fails to  confront  the SEC ’s past findings and provide good reasons for departing 
from them . The SEC has not articulated why the current principles -based system of  
environment al disclosure is insufficient.26 Similarly, th e SEC has long concluded that 
“disclosure relating to environmental and other matters of social concern should not 
be required of all registrants unless appropriate to further a specific congressional 
mandate or unless, under the particular facts and circu mstances, such matters are 
material. ”27 For the SEC to change its position dramatically from a prior regime, as 
the proposed rule seeks to do, it must (1) “display awareness that it is changing 
position, ” (2) “show that there are good reasons for the new policy ” and (3) “take[] into 
account ” “reliance interests ” on the prior policy.28 Because the proposed rule fails to 
do this , it is arbitrary and capricious.  
Third, t he proposed rule is arbitrary and capricious because it will impose 
extensive costs  with only minimal benefits.  The SEC has a “unique obligation ” under 
the Exchange Act to “consider the  effect of a new rule upon efficiency, competition 
and capital formation. ”29 Just over a year  ago, the SEC conducted a  full cost-benefit 
analysis  and determi ned that a principles -based approach had greater net benefits 
than a  prescriptive approach.30 Because this recent  reaffirmation rested on robust 
factual findings, the SEC would  have to provide  an even more robust analysis to 
explain the abrupt change in co urse of the proposed rule.31 It does not . The costs of 
the proposed rule will be  vast—the SEC estimates about  $15.3 billion, with over $3.5

 billion of that in the first year alone32—but then acknowledges  that it  underestimate s 
true costs because it cannot “fully and accurately quantify ” the costs of emissions 
reporting .33 To offset these costs  the proposed rule only suggests that the mandated 
disclosures “could ” yield public benefits —but those benefits are minimal at best  
becau se registrants already must disclose material climate information .34 As noted 
above, the proposed rule will actually harm investors by burying them in an 
avalanche of trivial information, making it even harder to separate the relevant and 
irrelevant climate information. Because the proposed rule does not provide sufficient 
evidence  that it passes a cost -benefit analysis, it is arbitrary and capricious.   
Fourth, the  proposed rule is arbitrary and capricious because it does not 
adequately address the significant reliance interests that have grown up  around the 
decades -old principles -based system. Regulated entities will have  to reshape  their 
processes to shift from a principles -based approach to a prescriptive approach.35 This 
will impose substantial co st as companies will need to determine and disclose vast 
amounts of data  that will sometimes be nearly impossible to d etermine accurately. 
Because of the lack of certainty, these disclosures will likely also generate substantial 
liability. The SEC cannot simply ignore these serious reliance interests.36  
Finally, the SEC’s reliance on climate -activist investor groups cal ls for  climate -
related risk disclosures in justifying the proposed rule renders the rule arbitrary and 
capricious.  Many groups —like Climate Action 100+  and C eres—whom the SEC 
points to as calling for climate -risk disclosures do so not because they  believe the 
disclosures will foster investor confidence or improve financial performance, but 
because they believe they will help combat climate change. In response to the wishes 
of these groups , the SEC bases the  prop osed rule largely  off global disclosure regimes 
like the GHG protocol and disclosures designed by the Task Force on Climate -Related 
Financial Disclosure that are more focused on climate change than financial 
performance. These justifications  bring the SEC ’s disregard of statutory factors to a 
new level  and explicitly go beyond American concepts of  investor protection.37 Indeed,

approach).

may suffice in other circumstances, but here -in particular because of decades of industry reliance on 
the Department's prior policy -the explanation fell short of the age ncy's duty to explain why it deemed 
it necessary to overrule its previous position. ”). 
37 See, e.g. , Roberta S. Karmel, Disclosure Reform -the SEC ls Riding Off in Two Directions at 
Once , 71 Bus. Law. 781, 815 (20 16) (“In spring 2014, the European Parliament  passed a law that will 
go into effect in 2017, requiring publicly traded companies with more than 500 employees to report on 
nonfinancial sustainability factors. ”). 11 
 even the SEC ’s own advisory committee has acknowledged the incompatibility of 
approaches  like these  with the Exchang e Act.38  This reliance is therefore contrary to 
law and also arbitrary and capricious.  
The Proposed Rule Violate s the First Amendment  
The Supreme Court recently reiterated that more lenient First Amendment 
scrutiny applies  only to laws requiring the discl osure of “purely factual, 
uncontroversial information. ”39 Beyond this limited exception, the  Court ’s precedents 
“have long protected the First Amendment rights of professionals, ”40 and 
“[c]ommercial speech is no exception .”41 As the D.C. Circuit has explai ned, t his is 
particularly so when a securities disclosure rule is “directed at achieving overall social  
benefits ” rather than “generat[ing] measurable, direct economic benefits to investors 
or issuers. ”42 If it were otherwise, the SEC could  “easily regulate otherwise protected 
speech using the guise of securities laws. ”43 
For these  “social benefits ” regulations, no form of securities exceptionalism or 
lax First Amendment standards  apply.44 Instead, “compelling an issuer to  confess 
blood on its hands  . . . interferes with th[e] exercise of the freedom of speech under 
the First  Amendment. ”45 The D.C. Circuit applied this reasoning to hold the Dodd -
Frank ’s conflict  minerals provision unconstitutional.  
A climate -related  mandatory standard  so expansive an d untethered from 
traditional case-by-case materiality standards is clearly designed to regulate the 
climate behavior  of registrants and their suppliers —putting it far beyond the “purely 
factual, uncontroversial ” type of disclosures the Supreme Court has a uthorized. The 
goal is to impose an unconstitutional “name and shame ” that is intended to let  
activists target companies deemed insufficiently  dedicated to addressing  climate  
change .46 Thus, t he proposed rule only serve s as a means to a political end , and that 
is directly relevant to whether the proposed rule passes muster under the First 
Amendment . As Commissioner Peirce explains, “the information is unrelated, or only 
tangentially related, to the statutory objectives [o f the SEC], ” meaning “it likely is

Analysis of our climate -related performance must  not fail to include the 
positive benefits we have brought to U-Haul customers and the country for over 75 
years. We  are proud to have provided to hundreds of millions of people the most 
affordable and environmentally friendly method to move  to a better life for 
themselves and their families. U -Haul has intentionally soug ht to reduce its carbon 
footprint by allowing most United States residents the ability to rent U -Haul 
equipment  within a short distance from their home. This includes  thoughtfully 
investing in new locations in  historically underserved and lower income 
neighborhoods, often as the first or only national  business in these areas, hiring 
locally and allowing local residents the same opportunity to improve  their lives.  
U-Haul takes seriously our commitment to  our investors, to our customers, to 
the env ironment, and to reducing  greenhouse gas emissions. But the proposed rule 
contains serious practical  issues, as well as numerous  legal and constitutional 
violations.  
* *  * 
Postface: A Personal Note from the Chairman  
I anticipate as this disclosure rule evolves you will expect me to hire 
“consultants” to opine on the “progress” , or lack of , that AMERCO/U -Haul is making 
towards our projected carbon neutral future.  
Then , you will require my signature to represent that this “comparable 
measur ement” on these GHG  emissions  is accurate. It will be extrapolated from 
multiple data points, most of which have a range of at least twenty percent plus or 
minus. Our hired “expert” will take these estimates and manipulate them summing 
or dividing or graph ing them until the “data” is a compilation of estimates upon 
estimates. My statistics professor alerted me to this mistake decades ago. The data 
will not be precise . 
Not to worry. The Federal Government will back away from its own data as 
“critical” or “me asurable” dates occur. We have already seen this done with global 
climate accords.  
 
47 Comm ’r Hester M. Peirce, We Are Not the Securities and En vironment Commission —At Least 
Not Yet , Mar. 21, 2022, https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/peirce -climate -disclosure -20220321 . 13 
 However you plan to have trapped me and this public company into publishing 
and attesting to data that we already know is not accurate – Yet you expect me to 
hire “experts”  who will do extensive/expensive studies of our GHG emissions, those 
of our customer, those of our suppliers. These studies will include the standard 
disclaimer that the “Company” (me and AMERCO/U -Haul) are solely responsible for 
the data and the “expert” did not/could not independently verify the data points.  
This is a classic Catch 22 that I am not going to willingly participate in. Yet, if 
the Company and I refuse to participate in promulgating this inaccurate data, (read 
lies) the SEC will encourage mar kets and regulators to punish us. If we do 
participate, t he big plaintiff firms will learn about this “misinformation”, which they 
will assert investors/lenders relied upon. They will find a market dip and allege 
enormous damages.  
You have asked for feedb ack on your proposed GHG disclosures. Well now you 
will have mine. The outright confusion, possible fraud, misinformation, lack of 
comparability that this proposed regulation causes will be substantial. On top of that , 
the SEC expects the Company to spend Shareholder dollars in this colossal 
misadventure.  
It is not part of our business practice to fritter away Shareholder dollars. Yet 
this rule will result in ongoing economical waste on an annual basis.  
Now the SEC wants to jump on board. You have hundreds of pages in your 
proposed rule. You will have me hire “consulting experts” offering to guide ignorant 
companies like AMERCO/U -Haul through this wasteful regulatory morass, which is 
not sustainable.  
I do not go willingly into your destructive use of custome r and shareholder’s 
money. As a capitalistic business we are supposed to be getting the customers a better 
deal. Creating an improved standard of living with our products and services.  
This GHG rulemaking is worse than nonsense.  
Actually, AMERCO/U -Haul ha s been consciously working on Sustainability for 
over 30 years.  
In 1962 we adopted a Primary Service Objective: “To provide a better and 
better product and  service to more and more people at a lower and lower cost.” We 
clearly understand that customer cos t includes any degradation of the environment. 
We are now 60 years into this effort.  
Some specifics:  14 
 • Truck fuel economy – We pioneered a fuel economy gauge in 1973. In 2008 we 
were able to get Ford to make it a default setting in the truck’s information 
display.  
• Trailer renting – A trailer is the single greatest way to impact the GHG and 
carbon footprint of a household mover. For a temporary time period a standard 
automobile can transport as much as a full -size pickup with a modest 
temporary increase in fu el consumption.  
• Airflow enhancements – Rounded van box corners and Mom’s Attic carry 
airflow from windscreen over the van body roof, which combined with lower 
overall height than competitors  and wind deflecting side skirts increase fuel 
economy . 
• Penske Tru ck Rentals owner Roger Penske has a truck that transports his race 
cars that is streamlined like a bullet train. Yet his rental trucks look like 
parachutes. When asked about the difference, Roger replied “I don’t buy the 
gas”. He can easily follow U -Haul w ith streamlining. We did the work over the 
past decades and now Penske will appear to be making great progress and U -
Haul not so great progress, confusing and misleading investors.  
• Propane fuel – U-Haul maintains the largest propane vehicle refueling 
netw ork in the USA. An enormous commitment to Alternative Fuels that is 
now out of vogue. We have tried to help.  
• Location strategy – U-Haul maintains more than 23,200 locations in North 
America. GHG emissions are reduced as customer/user has less distance to 
travel to obtain rental equipment. A massive reduction in miles traveled. A key 
part of our over 40 -year Truck Sharing strategy.  
• Rotation vehicles – Rather than sell vehicles, U -Haul deploys higher mileage 
vehicles into neighborhood locations. Over a 10 -year timeframe, each such 
shared vehicle results in replacing 19 high -capacity vehicles in the area.  
• Packing peanuts are made from starch, not Styrofoam. Reusable moving boxes 
made from 34% post -consumer recycle. Moving blankets made from salvage 
fabric fi bers. Reusable moving containers.  
• Sustainable storage – Truck van boxes reused as self -storage rooms after the 
truck itself is worn out and scrapped. A van box becomes a building 100% 
reuse.  
• Building reuse – Over 50% of our 76,000,000 sq ft of self -storage  is in reused 
buildings. By repurposing buildings, we save all the GHG created by 
demolition and haul away. We avoid the enormous GHG consequences of new 
building construction using concrete, steel, and gypsum. No one in the self -
storage business compares.  This will be hidden by your prepared standards.  
These are some of the ways AMERCO can and has been lowering its carbon 
footprint and GHG emissions. The proposed regulations take us away from what we 
know and can do to what is unknowable and likely undoable.  15 
 This is not to say we will fail to embrace EV fleet solutions if and when something 
is workable and is actually offered for sale. We would embrace this to the extent it 
serves our customer’s truck sharing needs. Contrary to the hype, a  battery el ectric 
truck that can travel Phoenix to Flagstaff (120 miles) in June does not exist in 
prototype or even in concept.   
Help me make sense out of your proposed regulation. I have been living this my 
entire adult life. My family will be laboring under these rules. I am giving you 
feedback from a person who will have to operate under the proposed rules. I will not 
be moving o n to another job. I read your proposed rule and can see ten years out.  
 
Thank you,

Proposal on Climate -Related Disclosures for Investors  
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (“the Commission ”) on the captioned Proposed Rule released on March 21, 2022, 
and published on April 11, 2022 relating to climate -related disclosures (“the Proposed  Rule”). 
The undersigned Associação Brasileira das Companhias Abertas  (Brazilian Association 
of Publicly Held Companies, or “ ABRASCA ”) and Instituto Brasileiro de Relações com 
Investidores  (Brazilian Institute of Investor Relations, or “ IBRI”) recognize th e importance of the 
Commission’s mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, 
facilitating capital formation, and promoting public trust in the market environment. We appreciate 
the significant amount of time and effor t the Commission and the Staff have put into developing 
the Proposed Rule and creating greater market transparency. The comments expressed in this 
letter represent the views of ABRASCA and IBRI, but have not been individually approved by, 
and therefore do not represent the individual       position of       their members.  
ABRASCA  
ABRASCA       is a not -for-profit entity that brings together, since 1971, the most important 
publicly held companies in all sectors in Brazil. ABRASCA’s members represent more than 80% 
of the total market capitalization of B3, the Brazilian stock exchange. ABRASCA’s m ission is to 
advocate for the interests of Brazilian issuers and their shareholders, with a view to create a fair, 
adequate and efficient regulatory system.  
IBRI 
IBRI       is a not -for-profit entity created in J une 1997 with the purpose of aggregating 
Investor Relations professionals in the Brazilian capital market. IBRI’s mission is to train and value 
the Investor Relations professionals, stimulating and promoting best practices of Brazilian 
companies and such p rofessionals.  
While we do not seek to comment on every item contained in the Proposed Rule, we do 
have concerns and suggestions on specific items, as set forth below.  
A. Financial Statements Note – The 1% Threshold  
The Proposed Rule would create a new Article  14 of Regulation S -X requiring a registrant 
to include specific climate -related financial disclosure in the notes to its audited financial 
statements. In particular, registrants would be required to include disaggregated information 
about the impact of cl imate -related conditions and events, and transition activities, on the 
consolidated financial statements included in the relevant filing, unless such impact is less than 
one percent of the total line item for the relevant fiscal year.  
We believe that such threshold is excessively low and will present significant 
complications for the registrants’ systems and internal controls, without necessarily presenting 
materially useful information to investors. Registrants will need to develop systems to analyze 
and c lassify the information required under the Proposed Rule, and they will need to integrate 
those systems with existing financial reporting systems and Internal Control over Financial Report 
(ICFR).  LEGAL_US_E # 163178361.2  
DRAFT 06/08/22   Also, each of the financial impact metrics must be presented “on an aggregated line -by-
line basis for all negative impacts and, separately, at a minimum, on an aggregated line -by-line 
basis for all positive impacts.” However, for purposes of determining wh ether the disclosure 
threshold has been met, a registrant would be required to aggregate the absolute value of the 
positive and negative impacts on a line -by-line basis, which makes the threshold even lower. For 
example, a 0.5% negative impact aggregated w ith a 0.5% positive impact would already trigger 
the 1% threshold, while the real utility for the investor would be the net financial impact (zero).  
In addition, the Commission argues in its release that the “one -size-fits-all” materiality 
threshold will p romote comparability and consistency among different registrants compared to a 
principles -based approach. While we understand the argument, we believe that a principles -
based approach would be preferable since it would allow registrants with different size s and in 
different industries to evaluate the materiality threshold that would make more sense, taking into 
consideration guidance and pronouncements from accounting bodies, discussions with their 
auditors and benchmarking with comparable registrants. A fi xed low materiality threshold tends 
to become obsolete with time and may produce an unreasonable burden to smaller companies 
or certain industries .      
For the reasons above, we respectfully suggest       the Commission to consider one 
of the followings approaches: (i) change the materiality threshold to a principles -based 
approach,  in which every company may calculate and explain its threshold; or  (ii) raise the 
threshold to 5% or more .      
B. The Financial Statements Note – Periods to be Presented  
Under the Proposed Rule, the financial metrics shall be required for all periods for whi ch 
financial statements are presented (typically two years for the balance sheet and three years for 
the income statement). We believe that the quantification of the financial impact metrics will 
already be challenging with respect to the first period afte r the Proposed Rule becomes effective, 
let alone for prior periods. We anticipate significant difficulties in obtaining such information for 
comparative periods in the first years of presentation      .  
Although the Commission permits the omission of such information in prior periods if “it 
is not reasonably available without unreasonable effort or expense”, it would be preferable to 
make disclosure of prior periods voluntary and let registrants whether they want to disclose prior 
periods in light of the costs, effort and expense involved vis -à-vis the      anticipated  utility for 
investors.  
For the reasons above, we respect fully suggest       that financial impact metrics of 
climate -related conditions and events on the consolidated financial statements should be 
required only for the first fiscal year and subsequent years after the new disclosure 
standards become applic able, and not for prior years  in terms of providing comparative 
information .  
C. Financial Statements Note – Impracticability  
Under the proposed Article 14 of Regulation S -X, registrants would be required to include 
disaggregated information about the impact of climate -related conditions and events, and 
transition activities, on the consolidated financial statements included in t he relevant filing, unless 
such impact is less than one percent of the total line item for the relevant fiscal year. We anticipate 
significant difficulties, including impracticability, in obtaining such disaggregated information when 
the impact is a result  of a mixture of factors (e.g., a factory shutdown due to an employee strike 
that occurs simultaneously with, or in close proximity to, a severe weather event).  
  
For the reasons above, we respectfully suggest       that a registrant could inform       
that it was unable to disclose the information on a disaggregated basis due to 
impracticability when the related impact is a result of a mixture of factors.  LEGAL_US_E # 163178361.2  
DRAFT 06/08/22   D. Financial Statements Note – Severe Weather Events and Other Natural Conditions  
  Under the proposed new Article 14 of Regulation S -X, registrants would be required to 
disclose in the notes to its audited financial statements, among other things, the financial impacts 
of severe weather events and other natural conditions, and related ex penditures to mitigate risks 
of such severe weather events and other natural conditions. Although the Proposed Rule has 
provided some specific examples of such events and conditions, in our opinion, the climate -
related events that are covered by “severe we ather events and other natural conditions” are 
unclear under the proposals. Accordingly, the lack of a definition or additional guidance related to 
such events and conditions may harm comparability and consistency among different registrants.  
For the reaso ns above, we respectfully suggest       that (i) the disclosures related 
to severe weather events and other natural conditions should be limited to only certain 
examples of severe weather events and other natural conditions specified by the 
Commission ; or (ii) the Commission provides additional guidance or examples about what 
events would be covered by “severe weather events and other natural conditions” , since 
the concept here is too wide to be achieved without additional guidance.       
E. Financial Stat ements Note – Financial Estimates and Assumptions  
Under the proposed new Article 14 of Regulation S -X, registrants would be required to 
disclose in the notes to their audited financial statements, among other things, whether the 
estimates and assumptions u sed to produce the consolidated financial statements were impacted 
by exposures to risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, climate -related 
events and by risks and uncertainties associated with, or known impacts from, a potential 
transition to a lower carbon economy or any climate -related targets disclosed by the registrant. 
Such proposal does not provide a threshold to determine the estimates and assumptions that 
would be required to be disclosed in the notes. Hence, it may lead to e xcessive, irrelevant 
disclosure that would cloud investors’ understanding of the material aspects of financial 
statements.  
For the reasons above, we respectfully suggest       that the disclosure of estimates 
and assumptions associated with climate -related events and transition activities should 
be limited to those that have materially impacted, or could have been reasonably expected 
to materially impact, the financial statemen ts.  
F. Financial Statements Note – Segment Level and Cost of Capital  
[The Commission requests comments as to whether registrants should be required to 
disclose the financial statements metrics at a reportable segment level (request for comment #54) 
and wheth er registrants should disclose changes to the cost of capital resulting from the climate -
related events (request for comment #69).]  
 In our opinion, the disclosure of the financial      statements’  metrics at a reportable segment 
level may lead to  excessive, irrelevant disclosure that would cloud investors’ understanding of the 
material aspects of financial statements.  
 We also believe that the disclosure of changes to the cost of capital resulting from the climate -
related events may pose significa nt challenges.   
 In this context, in response to request for comments 54 and 69 of the adopting release, 
we believe that the Commission should not require registrants to disclose the financial 
statements metrics at a reportable segment level neither the c hanges to the cost of capital 
resulting from the climate -related events.  
G. Financial Statements Note - Inclusion of Climate -Related Metrics  
Under the Proposed Rule, the proposed financial statement metrics would be included in 
the scope of any required aud it of the financial statements. However, under the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards LEGAL_US_E # 163178361.2  
DRAFT 06/08/22   Board (“IASB”), the proposed financial statement metrics are not required. In our opinion, 
decision -useful information to investors would also be provided if financial statement metrics were 
required to be disclosed as unaudited supplemental financial information instead.  
For the reasons above, for Foreign Private Issuers (or “ FPIs ”) that file consolida ted 
financial statements under IFRS as issued by the IASB, we respectfully suggest       that the 
proposed financial statement metrics be allowed to      be disclosed as unaudited 
supplemental financial information.  
H. Disclosure Regarding Climate -Related Impacts on Strategy, Business Model and 
Outlook – Internal Carbon Price  
  
Pursuant to the Proposed Rule, a registrant would be required to disclose an internal 
carbon price. In particular, registrants would be required to disclose the price in units of the 
registrant’s currency ton of CO 2e, the total price, the boundaries for measurement and the 
rationale for selecting the internal carbon price applied.  
 
The proposed rule is not clear on whether internal carbon prices used in a sensitive or 
scenario analysis of projects under evaluation should be disclosed.  While carbon prices can take 
a variety of forms and amounts, and a variety of ways that the cost of carbon can be integrated 
into business practices, disclosure of how internal carbon price is used would 
provide  transparency.  
 
For the reasons above, we respectfully suggest       that a registrant could only 
disclose  qualitative information about how  the internal carbon price is used in registrant’s 
business strategy.  
 
I. The Attestation Requirement  
Under proposed Item 1505 of Regulation S -K, a registrant that is an accelerated filer or 
a large accelerated filer would be required to provide an attestation report covering Scopes 1 and 
2 GHG emissions disclosure. The attestation report shall be prepared  and signed by an 
independent provider who is an expert in GHG emissions.  
While both the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework 
and the GHG Protocol contain general guidance on the verification of GHG emissions data, 
neither i mposes a mandatory requirement for the verification of such data by an independent third 
party. Similarly, applicable laws in different jurisdictions generally do not require mandatory third -
party attestation of GHG emissions.  
We believe that the cost of t hird-party attestation could be significant for registrants. 
Imposing an attestation requirement on all registrants would cause the development of a new 
industry of third -party service providers, without necessarily bringing value to investors.  
Therefore, the attestation report required is complex and time consuming, and we believe 
that the deadlines in the Proposed Rules for such report may not be feasible.   
For the reasons above, for all registrants, we respectfully suggest that (i) the third -
party attes tation of GHG emissions should be voluntary; (ii) the attestation work should 
not follow pre -defined levels of assurance (limited vs. reasonable assurance); and (iii) the 
attestation report should not be required to be filed with the Commission (but only 
available elsewhere in other forms of disclosure) to avoid triggering expert liability and 
further increasing the fees charged by the attestation providers.  
In addition, the Commission has repeatedly offered regulatory accommodations to FPIs1, 
and permitte d FPIs to abide by the laws and regulations of their home jurisdiction or stock 
 
1 FPIs receive certain regulatory concessions compared to those received by U.S. domestic issuers. For example: (i) 
annual reports:  FPIs must file their annual reports on Form 20 -F within four months after the fiscal year (compared to 60 
or 90 days applicab le to domestic issuers filing their annual reports on Form 10 -K); (ii) quarterly reports : FPIs are not LEGAL_US_E # 163178361.2  
DRAFT 06/08/22   exchange(s), and we believe that the FPIs should receive regulatory concessions with respect to 
the attestation requirement.  We respectfully suggest that FPIs should be exempt from the 
requirement to provide a third -party attestation report covering Scopes 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions, unless such report is required by the laws and regulations of their home 
jurisdiction or stock exchanges, or if an FPI has decided to contract such atte station 
voluntarily or by virtue of contractual obligations. Alternatively, we request that the 
Commission allows a longer phase -in period for FPIs to comply with the obligation to 
provide the GHG emissions attestation report.  
J. GHG Emissions Methodology  
Under the proposed rules, a registrant would be required to set the organizational 
boundaries for its GHG emissions disclosure using the same scope of entities, operations, assets 
and other holdings within its business organization as those included in, an d based upon the 
same set of accounting principles applicable to, its consolidated financial statements.  
According to GHG Protocol, two distinct approaches can be used to consolidate GHG 
emissions: The equity share and the control approaches. The GHG Prot ocol provides flexibility to 
registrants to choose methods and approaches that meet the circumstances of their business, as 
long they are transparent about the methods and assumptions used.    
For the reasons above, for all registrants, we respectfully sug gest that Commission 
(i) require registrants to use the organizational boundary approaches recommended by 
the GHG Protocol (e.g., financial control, operational control or equity share); (ii) permit a 
registrant to choose one of the approaches recommended by the GHG Protocol.  
K. Scope 3 GHG Emissions Disclosure  
Pursuant to the Proposed Rule, a registrant would be required to disclose Scope 3 GHG 
emissions if “material” or if the registrant has set a GHG emissions reduction target or goal that 
includes its Scope 3 GHG emissions. The requirement is not applicable to smaller reporting 
companies (or “SRCs”).  
Initially, we note that the definitions, methodologies and disclosure standards of Scope 3 
GHG emissions are still evolving and being gradually improved a round the world with the work of 
industry experts and the academic community. A mandatory requirement by the Commission 
might be counterproductive.  
Without an internationally accepted methodology for calculating Scope 3 GHG emissions, 
mandatory disclosure  required by the Commission will not serve to achieve greater transparency 
if different companies may report based on different inputs and definitions. We believe that the 
Commission should not create a mandatory requirement of Scope 3 GHG emissions 
disclo sure until there is a more accurate and widely accepted methodology for calculating 
Scope 3 GHG emissions.  
In addition, the Commission has repeatedly offered regulatory accommodations to FPIs2, 
and we believe that the FPIs should receive regulatory conces sions with respect to Scope 3 GHG 
emissions.  We respectfully suggest that, in addition to SRCs, FPIs should also be exempt 
from such requirement, unless disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions is required by the 
 
required under U.S. federal securities laws to file or make public quarterly financial information; (iii) proxy solicitation : 
FPIs are not required under  U.S. federal securities laws or the rules of the U.S. national securities exchanges to file 
proxy solicitation materials on Schedule 14A or 14C in connection with annual or special meetings of shareholders; (iv) 
audit committee : there are numerous accommo dations to the nature and composition of an FPI’s audit committee or 
permitted alternatives; (v) management compensation disclosure : an FPI is exempt from the detailed disclosure 
requirements regarding individual executive compensation and compensation ana lysis (an FPI is required to make 
certain disclosures regarding executive compensation on an individual basis unless it is not required to do so under 
home -country laws and the information is not otherwise publicly disclosed by the FPI); and (vi) directors ’/officers’ equity 
holdings : directors and officers of an FPI do not have to report their equity holdings and transactions under Section 16 of 
the Exchange Act, subject to certain exceptions.  
2 See footnote 1 above.  LEGAL_US_E # 163178361.2  
DRAFT 06/08/22   laws and regulations of their home jurisdiction or stock exchanges, or if such FPIs 
calculate and disclose Scope 3 GHG emissions voluntarily or by virtue of contractual 
obligations. Alternatively, we request that the Commission allows a longer phase -in period 
for FPIs to comply with Scope 3 GHG emission s disclosure.  
L. Climate Targets and Goals  
Under Item 1506 of Regulation S -K, registrants will be required to disclose if they have 
set any targets or goals related to the reduction of GHG emissions or any other climate -related 
targets or goals. The Proposed Rule does not use any materiality thresh old, but instead require 
the disclosure of all such targets and goals. Also, the Proposed Rule is not clear if registrants will 
be required to disclose in their SEC filings only the targets and goals that have been publicly 
disclosed, or any and all  climat e targets and goals, even if not public. For example, will the 
registrant be required to incorporate in its SEC filings the climate -related targets and goals 
published on its website or its sustainability reports? Would a registrant be required to disclose  
the climate -related targets and goals included in its financing agreements with lenders or business 
partners, or negotiated with environmental authorities or organizations? Would a registrant be 
required to disclose its internal climate -related targets an d goals? Would non -material climate -
related targets and goals be required to be disclosed?  
We note than an overly broad requirement to disclose any and all climate -related targets 
and goals, public or not, material or not, may have chilling effect on regis trants actively setting 
aspirational goals for fear that public disclosure in official SEC filings may expose them to liability 
if the goals are not met.  
For the reasons above, we respectfully suggest that the Commission should 
require disclosure of climat e-related targets and goals that are material and that have been 
publicly disclosed. In our opinion, such disclosure requirement should not include internal 
or non -public targets and goals, nor those that are considered immaterial.  
M. Experience and Respon sibility of Board Members or Board Committees  
The proposed rules would require a registrant to disclose a number of board governance 
items. Under Item 1501(a)(1)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S -K, registrants must identify any board 
members or board committees responsible for the oversight of climate -related risks, and whether 
any member of a registrant’s board of directors has expertise in climate -related risks, with 
disclosure required in sufficient detail to fully describe the nature of the expertise.  
The Commission has not defined what constitutes “exp erience in climate -related risks”. 
While we agree that such a definition may prove problematic, it would be important to indicate a 
list of non -exclusive criteria that registrants should consider in reaching a determination on 
whether a director has experi ence in the field. These criteria could include, for example, whether 
the director has prior work experience in sustainability or climate -related matters, or whether the 
director has obtained a certification or degree in in sustainability and climate -related matters. This 
approach would be consistent with Item 407(j) of the recently released rule about cybersecurity 
(Release Nos. 33 -11038; 34 -94382; IC -34529; File No. S7 -09-22). 
Also, the recently released rule about cybersecurity (Release Nos. 33 -11038; 34 -94382; 
IC-34529; File No. S7 -09-22) states that a person who is determined to have expertise in 
cybersecurity will not be deemed an expert for any purpose, including, without limitation, for 
purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77k), as  a result of being designated or 
identified as a director with expertise in cybersecurity (Item 407(j)(2)). Such safe harbor is 
important to clarify that Item 407(j) would not impose on such person any duties, obligations, or 
liability that are greater tha n the duties, obligations, and liability imposed on such person as a 
member of the board of directors in the absence of such designation or identification. The 
Commission notes that such safe harbor should alleviate such concerns for cybersecurity experts 
considering board service.  
We respectfully suggest that the Commission creates a similar safe harbor to 
protect the members of the board of directors or committees responsible for the oversight LEGAL_US_E # 163178361.2  
DRAFT 06/08/22   of climate -related risks.  It would be important to indicate a list of non -exclusive criteria 
that registrants should consider in reaching a determination on whether a director has 
experience in the field of climate -related risks. Since it is not clear what constitutes 
“experience in climate -related risks”, we recomme nd that, in line with TCFD, the 
Commission could require board committees responsible for the oversight of climate -
related risks, instead of a board member with expertise in climate -related risks .   
N. Alternative Reporting Provision  
The Proposed Rule does  not permit a registrant that is a FPI and subject to the climate -
related disclosure requirements of an alternative reporting regime that is substantially similar to 
the requirements of proposed Subpart 1500 of Regulation S -K and Article 14 of Regulation S -X 
to satisfy its disclosure obligations under those provisions by complying with the reporting 
requirements of an alternative reporting regime (“alternative reporting provision”).  If provided, 
such alternative reporting provision would have the potential  to reduce the compliance cost while 
providing useful information to investors.     
For the reasons above, we respectfully suggest       an alternative to satisfy the 
requirements of proposed Subpart 1500 of Regulation S -K and Article 14 of Regulation S -
X by complying with the reporting requirements of an alternative reporting regime.  
 
O. Transition Period for FPIs  
We acknowledge and agre e with the position of the Commission that climate -related risks 
potentially impact both domestic and foreign private issuers, regardless of the registrant’s 
jurisdiction of origin or organization. We, however, respectfully request the Commission to 
consid er a longer transition period for FPIs to comply with the proposed rules.  Such longer 
transition would be consistent with historical practice of the Commission when proposing new 
rules to FPIs.  In a number of instances, the Commission has acknowledged th at the compliance 
burden for FPIs, when compared to domestic issuers, may be higher and more time consuming. 
In fact, such principle is embedded in the four months that FPIs are given every year to file their 
annual report.  Also, foreign private issuers a re subject to different rules and regulations from 
different jurisdictions, which may need to be reconciled with the Commission disclosure rules.  As 
a matter of public policy, a longer transition period would also be the right incentive to continue to 
attract potential issuers from foreign jurisdictions to the U.S. capital markets, and investors would 
continue to be protected by general antifraud provisions under U.S. securities laws during the 
transition period.  
We respectfully suggest that the Commission  considers a longer transition period 
(e.g., a three year transition period) for FPIs consistent with historical practice of the 
Commission.

 Any prohibition against fraud and manipulation from hedge funds, corporations and those with the ability to influence prices will help retail, so please pass this through. The odds are already stacked against the retail trader. The SEC should be working to protect the retail trader from malicious actions taken by corporations, hedge funds, market makers, etc.

To that end, anything adding transparency to what those with large amounts of money do behind closed doors should be highly prioritized since the retail trader is purposefully left out of the loop so that a few groups can have \""first dibs\"" and always win and the retail trader is just left to trail behind.

Finally it should be telling that market makers, hedge funds, and wall street is so opposed to this ruling. Anything that levels the playing field is DIRECTLY in conflict with their profits. They don't want retail traders to have access to a fair market. The fact that the SEC has done so little in the face of manipulation, crime and deceit on such a broad level is disgusting. The least you can do is push this through and start doing more than just petty fines that are so small they are considered part of the \""cost of doing business.\""

Who do you work for? The retail traders? Or the few rich folks on wall street? Your decision on whether or not to push this proposal through will inform all of America whether you care more about protecting the average people of America or companies that only care about the bottom line and have shown countless times that they will lie cheat and steel in order to maintain power and profit margins."

To function effectively, capital markets participants need transparent and comprehensive, decision-useful data from all enterprises facing material climate change risks. Reliable, consistent and comparable climate-related disclosure at scale will provide investors and companies the information needed to allocate capital efficiently and in a manner that reduces risk and financial shocks or disruptions.  The SEC has always supported full and fair disclosure and focused on protecting investors, and we believe the SEC must view climate change as a topic where more disclosure is necessary to ensure investors receive consistent and accurate information from issuers on climate change that is material to making investment decisions.  Additionally, the SEC is tasked with ensuring effective functioning of capital markets, and we believe robust climate change disclosure would further enable regulators to more efficiently address and prepare for emerging climate-related issues that could cause climate-related financial market shocks that may have significant consequences for issuers, investors and shareholders.  AB views material risks and opportunities associated with climate change as fundamental financial factors that impact company cash flows and the valuation investors attribute to those cash flows. Regulatory changes, physical risks, and changing consumer decision criteria and preferences are all factors that asset managers need to understand and integrate into their investment processes to make optimal investment decisions on behalf of their clients.   Our views and comments below are based on our extensive experience with integrating climate change issues, data and information into our investment processes. Climate change poses a pervasive, significant risk to both capital markets and issuers. These include physical risks to real assets and supply chains from severe weather and transition risks from litigation and regulatory, technology, economic chĂŶŐĞƐĂƐĞĐŽŶŽŵŝĞƐƐƚƌŝǀĞƚŽŵĞĞƚ͞EĞƚĞƌŽ͕͟ǁŚŝĐŚŵĞĂŶƐĂůŝŐŶŝŶŐŐůŽďĂůĂĐƚŝǀŝƚŝĞƐǁŝƚŚĂtemperature increase below 1.5C as prescribed by the Paris Agreement.1 These risks are often non-linear and subject to unexpected feedback loops that can create disruptive impacts on asset valuations, global financial markets and economic stability. As a global asset manager, we invest in equity, debt and ĂůƚĞƌŶĂƚŝǀĞƐĞĐƵƌŝƚŝĞƐŐůŽďĂůůǇĂŶĚŝƚ͛ƐŝŵƉĞƌĂƚŝǀĞƚŚĂƚǁĞĚŝŵĞŶƐŝŽŶŚŽǁĐůŝŵĂƚĞĐŚĂŶŐĞĐĂŶĂĨĨĞĐƚdifferent geographies, economies, industries and companies, then factor material risks and opportunities related to climate change into fundamental research and investment decisions.   As a result of these efforts, AB has observed significant challenges in integrating material climate change considerations into the investment processes due to severe inconsistencies and weaknesses in corporate disclosures around climate change risks, opportunities and the strategy and management thereof. The variability and gaps in current disclosures frequently fail to capture material, financial climate risks faced by issuers and markets, thereby preventing investors from implementing efficient capital allocation and effective risk management.   As investors, we seek to motivate and engage issuers to manage climate change risk and opportunity in their operations, management, strategies, products and services, and to hold boards and management accountable for performance in this area. Despite the Climate Change Guidance that the Commission issued in 2010, disclosures currently do not support, and often undermine, these investor efforts and therefore also the effective functioning of capital markets. As a result, investors expend significant resources to identify, collect, estimate and manage climate disclosures and data.2 Efforts include purchasing data from third party vendors, reconciling gaps in these products and issuer disclosures, consulting with industry and scientific experts and developing proxy data from alternative sources.  It is clear from the proposed rule that the SEC has tried to incorporate much of the investor feedback received during the 2021 Requestion for Information, which AB responded to in June 2021.3  Mandating climate-related disclosure for registrants will accelerate the awareness in the US public and private sector of the growing risks and opportunities stemming from climate change. Such disclosure will also help companies prepare and plan for this transformation and protect investors and US competitiveness in the economies of the future. It could also reduce the burden of registrants from multiple and various requests for climate-related information from investors, data providers and other stakeholders.   Generally, AB believes the proposed rules will more adequately cover material climate risks, and lead to more consistent, comparable and reliable disclosures that will enable investors to make better decisions on how and where to allocate capital over the next several years. However, significant constraints and uncertainties persist today surrounding data, methodologies, scientific consensus, forecasts and resources as it pertains to climate change impacts on businesses across sectors, industries and regions.   1 See the Paris Agreement, 2015. The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015 and entered into force on 4 November 2016. Its goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. 2 6HH(50DQGWKH6XVWDLQ$ELOLW\,QVWLWXWH¶VCost of Climate Disclosure Survey Fact Sheet, May 2022. 3 6HH$OOLDQFH%HUQVWHLQ¶V/HWWHUWRWKH6(&¶V3XEOLF,QSXWRQ&OLPDWH&KDQJH'LVFORVXUH, June 2021.  Therefore, as a preface that applies to the areas of focus highlighted below (Sections 4 & 5) and the proposed rules more broadly, AB urges the Commission to:  1. institute its final rulemaking over a multi-year timeframe with appropriate phase-in periods and corresponding safe harbors for disclosures that are based on estimates, assumptions, forecasts and third-ƉĂƌƚǇĚĂƚĂƚŚĂƚŝƐŽƵƚƐŝĚĞŽĨƌĞŐŝƐƚƌĂŶƚ͛ƐĐŽŶƚƌŽůŽƌĐƵƌƌĞŶƚůǇƵŶƌĞůŝĂďůĞ. This approach will encourage issuers to disclose data without penalizing them for the challenges they face in reliability, collection and calculation of climate data from third parties and counterparties. We recognize that collecting and reporting this data is not easy and not costless to registrants or their shareholders. However, the benefits to investors and capital markets of increased understanding and transparency of climate risks and opportunities are greater than the costs of such disclosure over the long-term.   Where disclosure depends on estimates, forecasts, assumptions or external data that may be unreliable or subject to significant revisions, a phase-in period for disclosure complemented by safe harbors would mitigate the burden to issuers as well as provide a degree of protection from liability that could ultimately be damaging to shareholders. Such measures could also counteract the potential chilling effect of some of the proposed rules, i.e. the risk that registrants will avoid using certain climate risk assessment and management tools because they will then warrant disclosure.   In addition, implementing such measures would allow auditors and assurance providers time to adapt and develop the necessary human capital and organization infrastructure required to perform requisite services on such climate-related disclosures. This recommendation is particularly relevant for proposed rules on transition plans, scenario analysis, emissions reductions targets, Scope 3 emissions and impacts to financial statements under Article 14 of Regulation S-X;  2. focus disclosure thresholds on more widely understood and established concepts of ŵĂƚĞƌŝĂůŝƚǇ͕ĂƐŽƉƉŽƐĞĚƚŽƚŚƌĞƐŚŽůĚƐďĂƐĞĚŽŶƉƌĞǀŝŽƵƐƉƵďůŝĐĚŝƐĐůŽƐƵƌĞ͕͞ĚĞĐŝƐŝŽŶ-ƵƐĞĨƵůŶĞƐƐ͟ŽƌŝŶƚĞƌŶĂůƵƐĞ-cases within registrants. Please see responses from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) and the Investment Company Institute (ICI) to the comment period for more information on materiality; and   3. balance the rules with investor needs for disclosure of information that will be most material, reliable, comparable and useful while decreasing potential unintended consequences such as the chilling effect on the use of certain climate risk management tools because of new increased disclosure requirements. These tools include transition plans, climate scenario analysis, climate-related targets and internal emissions pricing.  We acknowledge that some investors and registrants indicate that requiring disclosure predicated on the use of such tools will incentivize registrants not to use these tools.

In particular, AB would like to highlight its support for the following elements of the proposed rules as particularly useful for investors and issuers to understand, price, and manage climate risks and opportunities:   a) Incorporating the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and recommendations of the Financial ^ƚĂďŝůŝƚǇŽĂƌĚ͛Ɛ Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) into the proposed rules. The TCFD recommendations have garnered support from thousands of companies and investors, including AB,4 as disclosure against the recommendations provide critical information for investors that allows us to effectively allocate capital and manage risk. Regulators and government agencies from several major economies have also begun to structure climate disclosure requirements based upon the TCFD recommendations, and we ƐƵƉƉŽƌƚƚŚĞĐŽŵŵŝƐƐŝŽŶ͛ƐĞĨĨŽƌƚƐƚŽŝŶĐŽƌƉŽƌĂƚĞĚŝƐĐůŽƐƵƌĞŽĨĞůĞŵĞŶƚƐƐƵĐŚĂƐ͗ i. Scenario analysis  ii. Governance  iii. Identification, assessment and management of climate-related risk iv. Impacts on strategy, business model and outlook v. Climate metrics and targets In particular, the inclusion of rules for disclosure around scenario analysis, with the caveats outlined in Sections 1, 2 and 3 above, will improve access to capital for registrants that can demonstrate resilience in a lower carbon economy. Scenario analysis is particularly important for those registrants in emissions-intensive industries where such analysis can demonstrate the quality of impairment testing and increase confidence in asset values. While many registrants claim to perform scenario analysis, however, there is little disclosure around assumptions used in these models and how registrants use results impact strategy, business and capital allocation decisions, making their results challenging to compare and incorporate in an investor use-case.  b) The mandate for registrants to disclose total Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

Internal carbon pricing can guide capital expenditures, research and design and other fundamental decisions towards projects, products and services that are more resilient to climate change and away from assets that may become economically unviable in the global transition to a lower carbon economy. While many companies claim to utilize internal emissions pricing, it is challenging for investors to assess the validity and strength of this mechanism without transparency on methodology, price and application.  ĂůƐŽďƌŽĂĚůǇƐƵƉƉŽƌƚƐƚŚĞŽŵŵŝƐƐŝŽŶ͛ƐƉƌŽǀŝƐŝŽŶƐĨŽƌĚŝƐĐůŽƐƵƌĞŽŶĐůŝŵĂƚĞ-related opportunities and transition plans; for smaller registrants receiving more time to comply with the proposed rules; and for both narrative and quantitative disclosure that will provide investors with comparable information in a common location as described in Regulation S-K.   5. /ŶĂĚĚŝƚŝŽŶƚŽ͛ƐƐƵƉƉŽƌƚŽƵƚůŝŶĞĚĂďŽǀĞ͕ǁĞďĞůŝĞǀĞƚŚĂƚsome aspects of the proposed rules can be better tailored to reduce the effect of unintended consequences that would prevent the proposed rules from achieving their objectives to support better investment and to mitigate costs on entities in which AB invests. As such, we encourage the Commission to consider the following revisions: a. Impacts to financial statements should be based on materiality and be presented under Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A). The proposed requirements would prompt registrants to disclose, in notes to the audited financial statements, climate changed-related impacts on any line items in the financial statements that have a greater than 1% impact on the respective line item.   5 6HH$%¶VSix Best Practices for Carbon Offsets, December 2021.  We support the greater disclosure of impacts on climate change on the financial results of registrants, as such disclosure would allow investors to better understand and value changes in asset values due to climate change.  However, including these impacts in audited notes to the financial statements as proposed under Article 14 of Regulation S-X, would be extremely challenging for registrants to implement given the internal procedures associated with such audited disclosures and the unique novelty, granularity, uncertainty presented by potential climate change impacts. In addition, more traditional tests of materiality should be applied to discerning such information for disclosure, as the proposed 1% financial impact thresholds on financial statement line items are highly burdensome, arbitrary and would not necessarily lead to more useful or comparable information for investors.   Including such disclosure in MD&A, by amending Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K to add express reference to climate-related impacts, would allow registrants to present such information in context with other quantitative and qualitative information describing year-over-year impacts on financial results, avoid a resource-intensive exercise that may inundate investors with a significant amount of non-material information, and reduce liability for disclosures that will in many cases rely on high degrees of assumptions and estimates.  b. Scope 3 Emissions disclosures should be triggered if they are material to the registrant, and focus on those emissions categories that are material to the registrant: The proposed requirement would prompt registrants to disclose emissions if the registrant determines that its total Scope 3 emissions are material or if the registrant has set a GHG emissions reduction target or goal that includes its Scope 3 emissions.6 In addition, if Scope 3 emissions disclosure is triggered, a registrant would have to disclose all 15 categories of such emissions, regardless of whether or not all categories are material to the registrant. AB supports the enhancement of disclosure around Scope 3 emissions. For registrants in many industries, Scope 3 emissions comprise the vast majority, upwards of 99%, of a ƌĞŐŝƐƚƌĂŶƚ͛ƐĞŵŝƐƐŝŽŶƐĨŽŽƚƉƌŝŶƚ͘'ŝǀĞŶƚŚĂƚŵŽƌĞƚŚĂŶϲϬĐŽƵŶƚƌŝĞƐĂŶĚũƵƌŝƐĚŝĐƚŝŽŶƐŚĂǀĞapplied or are implementing some type of carbon price, tax or trading system,7 ĂƌĞŐŝƐƚƌĂŶƚ͛Ɛmeasurement and management of these emissions is often a signal to their awareness and integration of climate change risk to their business. Management of Scope 3 emissions can also indicate how well a registrant is managing its impact on the communities and resources that it depends on to grow and maintain its business activities.  AB also acknowledges the challenges and costs registrants face in collecting, verifying and calculating Scope 3 emissions data. Lack of widely accepted methodologies and frameworks, as well as control of and transparency into entities within ĂƌĞŐŝƐƚƌĂŶƚ͛ƐǀĂůƵĞĐŚĂŝŶĐĂŶmake Scope 3 emissions disclosures challenging to produce and verify today. Indeed, many investors expend significant resources on purchasing and verifying products and services that deliver estimates and assumptions on Scope 3 emissions data, which are frequently inaccurate due to challenges in underlying assumptions and models.    6 See Securities and Exchange Commission, Proposed Rule: The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-related Disclosures for Investors ³6(&3URSRVDO´S470. 7 See the World Bank, State and Trends in Carbon Pricing 2020, p. 7, March 2020. Nonetheless, AB believes that increasing transparency, as would be required under the proposed rule, would improve the overall ecosystem for collecting, measuring and managing Scope 3 emissions and related data. In our view, the benefits to shareholders of having access to this information, when material, will ultimately outweigh the costs, which we anticipate would decline over time as efficiencies and industry best practices are developed and implemented.  We recommend that the trigger for disclosure of Scope 3 emissions be prompted by materiality, rather than prior public disclosure. For rationale supporting the focus on materiality, please Section 2 above. Similarly, AB recommends that Scope 3 emissions disclosures focus on categories of emissions that are material to the registrant. Disclosure across all 15 categories defined in the proposed rule would lead to unnecessary burden and cost for registrants and ultimately shareholders, and lead to inefficiencies for investors who will have to process more information that is ultimately not material to their decision-making process.  c. The proposed rules surrounding governance could be strengthened by requiring disclosure of whether and how executive renumeration is tied to climate-related performance. The proposed rule currently does not include language around disclosure of executive remuneration tied to climate-related performance.  In our view, executive pay is a powerful motivating factor and investors need to consider ǁŚĞƚŚĞƌĞǆĞĐƵƚŝǀĞƉĂǇŝŶĐĞŶƚŝǀĞƐĂƌĞĨƵůůǇĂůŝŐŶĞĚǁŝƚŚƚŚĞŐŽĂůƐŽĨƚŚĞƌĞŐŝƐƚƌĂŶƚ͛Ɛbusiness.8 Today, climate change is widely recognized as an essential factor to a proper evaluatioŶŽĨƚŚĞƌŝƐŬƐĂŶĚŽƉƉŽƌƚƵŶŝƚŝĞƐĨĂĐŝŶŐĂĐŽŵƉĂŶǇ͘&ŽƌƚŚĂƚƌĞĂƐŽŶ͕ďĞůŝĞǀĞƐŝƚ͛Ɛvital to incorporate climate change issues both into our investment research process and into executive compensation metrics for companies where climate change represents a material risk or opportunity. In this way, the full spectrum of risk, opportunity and goal-setting can be viewed in proper perspective. We find that companies with material exposure to climate change that have meaningful climate change goals embedded in their executive compensation programs tend to have a better understanding of the climate change risks and opportunities that are material to their business, use specific key performance indicators (KPIs) and are more likely to achieve goals.  dŚŝƐǀŝĞǁŝƐƐƵƉƉŽƌƚĞĚďǇƚŚĞƌĞƐƵůƚƐŽĨ͛Ɛ^'ŶŐĂŐĞŵĞŶƚĂŵƉĂŝŐŶ͕ǁŚŝĐŚŚĂƐĨŽĐƵƐĞĚon engaging with companies in our top holdings over the past several years to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics in executive compensation.9 In ĂĚĚŝƚŝŽŶ͕ƌĞƋƵŝƌŝŶŐĚŝƐĐůŽƐƵƌĞŽŶĞǆĞĐƵƚŝǀĞƌĞŵƵŶĞƌĂƚŝŽŶǁŽƵůĚĂůŝŐŶǁŝƚŚd&͛Ɛrecommendations.10   d.

For Proposed Rule No. S7 -10-22:  
The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate -Related Disclosures for Investors  
 
Dear Honorable Chairman Gensler,  
 
Thank you for accepting public comments on this important matter. Climate change poses 
both threats and opportunities to American businesses and disclosing such is an important 
part of both mitig ating risk and capitalizing on opportunities.  
 
The Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA), representing more than 310 member 
companies would like to share our overall support for Proposed Rule No. S7 -10-22 and its 
adoption, with our suggested modifications  herein, insofar as the Final Rule empowers and 
enhances transparency for the private sector to further scale decarbonization efforts in the 
U.S. and abroad.  
 
CEBA is a 501c6 business association with over 310 member companies representing more 
than $7 trillion in revenues and 16 million employees. CEBA activates a community of energy 
customers and partners to deploy market and policy solutions for a carbon -free electricity 
system. CEBA’s aspiration is to achieve a 90% carbon -free U.S. electricity system  by 2030 and 
to cultivate a global community of customers driving clean energy.  
 
CEBA supports the overall intent and expected impact of Proposed Rule No. S7 -10-22. CEBA 
also applauds the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for promoting greater 
transparency on climate -related disclosures and the anticipated incentive this ru le would 
create upon its adoption for companies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.  
 
Given our unique membership and areas of expertise, CEBA encourages the SEC to prioritize enabling companies to set and achieve ambitious decarbonization targets th rough carbon -
free electricity procurement. CEBA requests that the SEC consider the following specific recommendations to enhance the Proposed Rule’s efficacy, durability, and interoperability with fast- changing energy markets and customer needs in the Fina l Rule:
 
 
1. Change the phrase “Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)” to “Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs)” to align with global standards lexicon and promote a technology -
agnostic approach to carbon -free electricity (CFE) procurement . EACs are a more  
 
Clean Energy Buyers Association  
1425 K St. NW, Suite 1110, Washington, DC 20005  
Phone: 833.303.CEBA 
info@cebuyers.org  
cebuyers.org  expa nsive definition that better reflects current and next generation investments that 
companies are making to advance systemic electric grid decarbonization. EACs 
represent a more technology -inclusive approach to all CFE resources for any 
megawatt -hour (MWh) generated without polluting greenhouse gases. EACs also 
encompass standards beyond RECs in the United States, such as Guarantees of Origin 
(GOs) in Europe and International RECs (I -RECs) in more than 50 countries in Africa, 
Asia, and Latin America. This definition also reflects that EACs are going to evolve over 
time to reflect additional information on, for example, CFE matching on an hourly - 
and location -basis, and avoided, or displaced, marginal grid emissions from CFE 
procurement.  
 
2. Permit registrants to  report their carbon offsets and EACs on a percentage basis or 
volumetric basis . Many companies will be discouraged from procuring CFE if they 
must report the volume of MWh procured because this may reveal their cost structure to their competitors. Many co mpanies may also consider the volumes of 
carbon offsets and EACs they procure as confidential and proprietary information. By 
allowing companies to report the percentage progress they have made toward their 
goals rather than the amount of MWh procured, thi s will provide clearer and more 
actionable information to investors.  
 
3. Accept EACs procured through different CFE product offerings and allow companies 
to report differentiated impacts from CFE procurement . EACs are available in the 
market in different fo rms, from unbundled EAC products (where EACs are sold 
separately from electricity) to physically or virtually bundled EAC products like power 
purchase agreements (PPAs) and utility green tariff program participation. Companies procure different CFE product s to meet their unique goals and 
requirements. While EACs are the common denominator across CFE product 
offerings and should be reported to provide evidence of CFE procurements, 
companies that procure CFE also want to have the option to disclose additional  
details about how their different forms of procurement create different types of 
benefits (e.g., new CFE projects, community benefits, avoided emissions, etc.).  
 
4. Recognize challenges that companies will experience for Scope 3 disclosures across 
emission sources due to the complexity of Scope 3 estimations : There are various 
sources of greenhouse gas emissions upstream and downstream that contribute to a 
company’s Scope 3 emissions and data needed to measure emissions and emission reductions can be extremely limited. Estimated calculations for emissions originating from each Scope 3 source will vary in complexity. For example, it may be easier to estimate the emissions from a company’s staff travel compared to the production of each component in its upstrea m supply chain. Given the challenges of gaining access 
to necessary data to make these estimates and to accommodate a company’s best 
efforts for accurate estimates, the Final Rule should balance accuracy with best efforts 
to estimate each source of Scope 3  emissions.

5. Allow companies to use market instruments for disclosure of Scope 3 emission 
strategy and reductions : In line with the May 2022 guidance entitled “Renewable 
Electricity Procurement on Behalf of Others: A Corporate Reporting Guide” that was 
recently published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), companies 
should be able to apply market instruments like EACs from CFE procurement as part 
of the strategy and emission reductions they report for their Scope 3 emissions.  
 
We thank you  for working to promote market transparency so investors and consumers can 
consider climate risk more effectively in decision -making . We hope this Proposed Rule will be 
adopted with our guidance so that the Final Rule will further catalyze companies to scale their global decarbonization efforts.

October 10, 2022

 The proposed rule offers accountability to the companies that have made net-zero pledges in organizations. For example, vehicle manufacturing companies have made pledges emphasizing their focus on lowering emissions by emphasizing new technology for electric vehicles. Yet, they do not make it easier for people to buy these vehicles. If the government offers tax incentives of $7,500, they simply market the car for $7,500 more. There is no accountability, and no one is saying anything. If carbon offset accountability is not being taken seriously, then why would any investor consider such a company when it cannot keep simple promises? Perhaps there is a supply issue that is causing these setbacks? Or perhaps there has not been a plan to attack the problem. Basic control measures for emissions already exist, such as controlling vehicle miles, fuel efficiency, fuel content, and establishing emission controls. But even if we use the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) standards, it d
 oes not identify the financial shortfalls this article brings to light. If accountants are going to be asked to analyze GHG financials, how would we implement that into our GAAP procedures? Other programs within the government have been given agents to help, such as the IRS. The agency has been given the authority to hire over 87,000 new agents to cover the mission of the IRS. If the government really cared about GHG, it should implement a similar strategy or identify an existing agency to look into these organizations' financial statements. Sarbanes-Oxley will help with the accuracy of identifying shortfalls within accounting practices, but who will regulate them? Who has oversight on what they can and cannot oversee? What penalties can those who violate financial principles face? The time is now to identify where these \""credits\"" go to and why there has not been a push to help the American public achieve the same level of credits. Empty promises are made, and no one seems to care
 . The middle class is being dried up with the cost of living and the cost of items. Gas has risen, and electric vehicles are a justifiable answer. But the situation will worsen without real numbers, and the American people will continue to use GHG emission vehicles."

Dear Chair Gensler,  


I am writing to thank you for taking steps to make it easier for investors like me to understand climate risk.  


As an investor looking to maximize my returns, I need to know whether or not a company is preparing to be successful in a low-carbon world. More and more economies are adopting policies and taking steps to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Companies not working to reduce their Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse emissions may not be prepared for that future. Without this information, I won't be able to tell what companies are likely to continue to be profitable as the economy transitions to clean energy and which companies could put my savings at risk.  


Earlier this summer you proposed a rule to require publicly traded companies to disclose ""material"" Scope 3 emissions. Many investors - both asset managers and individual investors like me - asked you to make this a requirement for all large public companies, and I am hopeful that you will listen to the voices of regular people like me, not just big corporations looking to hide their risks.

The Enhancement and Standardization  of Climate-Related Disclosures for 
Investors
Dear Ms. Countryman:
The Securities Industry and F inancial Markets Association (“SIFMA”)
1appreciates the 
opportunity to provide these supplemental comments o n the Commission’s proposal2to enhance 
and standardize climate-related disclosures. The below proposed amendments to current Item 
303 of Regulation S-K seek to implement the approach discussed in SIFMA’s comment letter3
on the Commission’s proposal. In the comment letter, SIFMA stated that:
MD&A addresses the substance of what proposed Article 14 of Regulations 
S-X is intended to achieve. Item 303(b) of Regulation S-K requires that 
“[w]here the financial statements re flect material changes from period to 
period in one or more line items, including where material changes within a line item offset one another, describe the underlying reasons for these

encompasses climate-related impacts on financial statements. To the extent 
the Commission does not believe that re gistrants currently are adequately 
addressing climate-related matters in MD&A, the more tailored regulatory approach would be to amend Item 303 of  Regulation S-K to add an express 
reference to climate-related impacts. Information contemplated by proposed Article 14 of Regulation S-X is more useful in the MD&A than in the financial statements, since there it would be presented in context with other information describing year-over-year impacts on financial results. 
The information below provides some further detail and suggested amendments to the current Item 303 of Regulation S-K.  
 
* * * * * 
 
§ 229.303 (Item 303) Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and 
results of operations.  
 (a) Objective.  The objective of the discussion and analysis is to provide material information 
relevant to an assessment of the financial cond ition and results of operations of the registrant 
including an evaluation of the amounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources. The discussion and analysis must focus specifically on material events and uncertainties known to management that are reason ably likely to cause reported financial 
information not to be necessarily indicative of future operating results or of future financial condition. This includes descriptions and amounts of matters that have had a material impact on 
reported operations, as well as matters that are reasonably likely based on management's assessment to have a material impact on future operations. The discussion and analysis must be of the financial statements and other statistical data  that the registrant believes will enhance a 
reader's understanding of the registrant's financial condition, cash flows and other changes in financial condition and results of operations. A discussion and analysis that meets the 
requirements of this paragraph (a) is expected to better allow investors to view the registrant 
from management's perspective.   Instructions to paragraph (a) : The discussion of matters that have had a material impact on 
reported operations and matters that are reasonably likely based on management’s assessment to have a material impact on future operations should include a discussion of 
the consequences of severe weather events, climate-related regulation and climate-related 
business trends to the extent material to the registrant.
 
 (b) Full fiscal years.  The discussion of financial condition, changes in financial condition and 
results of operations must provide information as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of 
this section and such other information that the registrant believes to be necessary to an understanding of its financial condition, changes in  financial condition and results of operations. 
Where the financial statements reflect material changes from period-to-period in one or more 
line items, including where material changes within  a line item offset one another, describe the 
 
4 17 U.S.C. § 229.303(b). Page | 3  underlying reasons for these material changes in quantitative and qualitative terms. Where in the 
registrant's judgment a discussion of segment information and/or of other subdivisions ( e.g., 
geographic areas, product lines) of the registrant's business would be necessary to an 
understanding of such business, the discussion must focus on each relevant reportable segment and/or other subdivision of the business and on the registrant as a whole.  
(1) Liquidity and capital resources.  Analyze the registrant's ability to generate and obtain 
adequate amounts of cash to meet its requiremen ts and its plans for cash in the short-term 
(i.e., the next 12 months from the most recent fiscal period end required to be presented) 
and separately in the long-term ( i.e., beyond the next 12 months). The discussion should 
analyze material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations. Such disclosures must specify the type of obligation and the relevant time period for the related cash requirements. As part of this analysis, provide the information in paragraphs (b)(1)(i)  
and (ii)  of this section.  
(i) Liquidity.  Identify any known trends or any known demands, commitments, 
events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in 
the registrant's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. If a material deficiency is identified, indicate the course of action that the registrant has taken or proposes to take to remedy the defi ciency. Also identify and separately 
describe internal and external sources of liquidity, and briefly discuss any material 
unused sources of liquid assets.  (ii) Capital resources.   
(A) Describe the registrant's material cash requirements, including commitments for capital expenditures, as of the end of the latest fiscal 
period, the anticipated source of funds needed to satisfy such cash requirements and the general purpose of such requirements.  
(B) Describe any known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in the 
registrant's capital resources. Indicate any reasonably likely material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources. The discussion must consider changes among equit y, debt, and any off-balance sheet 
financing arrangements.  
(2) Results of operations.   
(i) Describe any unusual or infrequent ev ents or transactions or any significant 
economic changes that materially affected the amount of reported income from continuing operations and, in each case, indicate the extent to which income was so affected. In addition, describe any ot her significant components of revenues or 
expenses that, in the registrant's judgmen t, would be material to an understanding 
of the registrant's results of operations.  
(ii) Describe any known trends or uncertainties that have had or that are 
reasonably likely to have a material favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations. If the registrant knows of events that are reasonably likely to cause a material change in the relationship between costs and revenues (such as known or reasonably likely future increases in costs of labor or materials or price increases or inventory adjustments), the change in the relationship must be disclosed.  (iii) If the statement of comprehensiv e income presents material changes from 
period to period in net sales or revenue, if  applicable, describe the extent to which Page | 4  such changes are attributable to changes in prices or to changes in the volume or 
amount of goods or services being sold or to the introduction of new products or 
services.  
(3) Critical accounting estimates.  Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made 
in accordance with generally accepted acc ounting principles that involve a significant 
level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material 
impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. Provide 
qualitative and quantitative information necessary to understand the estimation 
uncertainty and the impact the critical accounti ng estimate has had or is reasonably likely 
to have on financial condition or results of operations to the extent the information is material and reasonably available. This information should include why each critical accounting estimate is subject to uncertainty a nd, to the extent the information is material 
and reasonably available, how much each estimate and/or assumption has changed over a 
relevant period, and the sensitivity of the reported amount to the methods, assumptions and estimates underlying its calculation.  
 Instructions to paragraph (b): 1. Generally, the discussion must cover the periods covered by the 
financial statements included in the filing and the registrant may use any presentation that 
in the registrant's judgment enhances a reader's understanding. A smaller reporting company's discussion must cover the two-year period required in §§ 210.8-01 through 
210.8-08 of this chapter  (Article 8 of Regulation S-X) and may use any presentation that 
in the registrant's judgment enhances a reader's understanding. For registrants providing financial statements covering three years in a filing, discussion about the earliest of the 
three years may be omitted if such discussion was already included in the registrant's prior filings on EDGAR that required disclosure in compliance with § 229.303  (Item 303 
of Regulation S-K), provided that registrants electing not to include a discussion of the earliest year must include a statement that identifies the location in the prior filing where the omitted discussion may be found. An e merging growth company, as defined in § 
230.405 of this chapter (Rule 405 of the Securities Act) or § 240.12b-2 of this chapter (Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act), may provide the discussion required in paragraph (b)  
of this section for its two most recent fiscal years if, pursuant to Section 7(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 ( 15 U.S.C. 77g(a) ), it provides audited fi nancial statements for 
two years in a Securities Act registration st atement for the initial public offering of the 
emerging growth company's common equity securities.  2. If the reasons underlying a material change in  one line item in the financial statements 
also relate to other line items, no repetition of  such reasons in the discussion is required 
and a line-by-line analysis of the financial st atements as a whole is neither required nor 
generally appropriate. Registrants need not recite the amounts of changes from period to period if they are readily computable from the financial statements. The discussion must 
not merely repeat numerical data contained in the financial statements. To the extent 
material to the registrant, directly attribut able financial impacts of severe weather events 
and directly attributable financial impact s related to material, publicly announced, 
firmwide goals or targets the primary purpose of which is to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2
5 
greenhouse gas emissions (as defined in Item [1500] of Regulation S-K) should be 
 
5 Limiting this instruction to Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions is co nsistent with developing disclosure 
requirements that are measurable and focused on the registrant. Page | 5  included when discussing the reasons underlying a material change in line items in the 
financial statements. 
(i) Severe weather events are acute weather-related events such as hurricanes, storms, and floods. Impacts of severe weather events may include (1) changes to revenues or costs from disruptions to business operations or supply chains of the registrant; (2) impairment charges and changes to the carrying amount of assets (such as inventory, intangibles, and property, plant and equipment) due to the assets being exposed to severe weather events; and (3) changes to loss contingencies or reserves (such as environmental reserves) due to direct impacts of severe weather events on the registrant. 
3. Provide the analysis in a format that facilitates easy understanding and that supplements, and does not duplicate, disclosure already provided in the filing. For critical 
accounting estimates, this disclosure must s upplement, but not duplicate, the description 
of accounting policies or other disclosures in  the notes to the financial statements.  
4. For the liquidity and capital resources disclosure, discussion of material cash requirements from known contractual obligations may include, for example, lease obligations, purchase obligations, or other liabil ities reflected on the registrant's balance 
sheet, as well as those needed to meet material, publicly announced, firmwide goals or 
targets the primary purpose of which is to reduce Scope 1 and Sc ope 2 GHG emissions, 
increase the resilience of assets or operations, retire or shorten the estimated useful lives of impacted assets, relocate assets or operations at risk, or otherwise reduce the future impact of severe weather events on the registrant’s business operations  (which may 
include research and development of new tec hnologies, purchase of assets, infrastructure, 
or products the primary purpose of which is to achieve such objectives). Except where it is otherwise clear from the discussion, the re gistrant must discuss those balance sheet 
conditions or income or cash flow items which the registrant believes may be indicators of its liquidity condition.  5. Disclosure related to critical accounting estimates materially impacted by risks and uncertainties associated with, or known imp acts from, severe weather events must 
provide a discussion of whether and how such id entified risks have materially affected or 
are reasonable likely to affect the cons olidated financial statements. To the extent 
practicable, provide a description of how the development of such estimates and 
assumptions were impacted by such events or activities.  6. Disclosure related to known trends or unc ertainties that have had or are reasonably 
likely to have a material impact on result s of operations should consider changes in 
demand for products and services that cr eate or reduce GHG emissions or likely 
reputational harm from such emissions, including a discussion of what impact such 
changes in demand or reputational harm w ould have on the registrant’s results of 
operations or financial condition, providing a qualitative description as practicable.
6 
7. Where financial statements presented or incorporated by reference in the registration 
statement are required by § 210.4-08(e)(3) of this chapter  (Rule 4-08(e)(3) of Regulation 
S-X) to include disclosure of restrictions on the ability of both consolidated and unconsolidated subsidiaries to transfer funds to the registrant in the form of cash 
dividends, loans or advances, the discussion of liquidity must include a discussion of the 
 
6 See Sample Letter to Companies Regard ing Climate Change Disclosures , available 
at https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/sample -letter-climate-change-disclosures .  Page | 6  nature and extent of such restrictions and the impact such restrictions have had or are 
reasonably likely to have on the ability of the parent company to meet its cash obligations.  
8. Any forward-looking information supplied is expressly covered by the safe harbor rule 
for projections. See 17 CFR 230.175  [Rule 175 under the Securities Act], 17 CFR 
240.3b-6 [Rule 3b-6 under the Exchange Act], and Securities Act Release No. 6084 (June 
25, 1979).  9. All references to the registrant in the discussion and in this section mean the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated.  10. Discussion of commitments or obligations, including contingent obligations, arising from arrangements with unconsolidated entities or persons that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on a registrant's financial condition, 
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, cash 
requirements or capital resources must be provided even when the arrangement results in no obligations being reported in the registrant's consolidated balance sheets. Such off-balance sheet arrangements may include: Guarantees; retained or contingent interests in assets transferred; contractual arrangements that support the credit, liquidity or market risk for transferred assets; obligations that arise or could arise from va riable interests held 
in an unconsolidated entity; or obligations related to derivative instruments that are both indexed to and classified in a registrant's own equity under U.S. GAAP.  11. If the registrant is a foreign private issuer, briefly discuss any pertinent governmental economic, fiscal, monetary, or political policies  or factors that have materially affected or 
could materially affect, directly or indirect ly, its operations or investments by United 
States nationals. The discussion must also consider the impact of hyperinflation if hyperinflation has occurred in any of the peri ods for which audited financial statements 
or unaudited interim financial statements are filed. See § 210.3-20(c) of this chapter  
(Rule 3-20(c) of Regulation S-X) for a discussion of cumulative inflation rates that may 
trigger the requirement in this instruction 9 to this paragraph (b) .  
12. If the registrant is a foreign private issuer, the discussion must focus on the primary financial statements presented in the registra tion statement or report. The foreign private 
issuer must refer to the reconciliation to United States generally accepted accounting principles and discuss any aspects of the di fference between foreign and United States 
generally accepted accounting principles, not discussed in the reconciliation, that the registrant believes are necessary for an understanding of the financial statements as a whole, if applicable.  13. The term statement of comprehensive income  is as defined in § 210.1-02 of this 
chapter  (Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X).  
(c) Interim periods.  If interim period financial statements are included or are required to be 
included by 17 CFR 210.3  [Article 3 of Regulation S-X], a management's discussion and 
analysis of the financial condition and results of operations must be provided so as to enable the reader to assess material changes in financial condition and results of operations between the 
periods specified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section. The discussion and analysis must 
include a discussion of material changes in  those items specifically listed in paragraph (b)  of this 
section.  
(1) Material changes in financial condition.  Discuss any material changes in financial 
condition from the end of the preceding fiscal year to the date of the most recent interim 
balance sheet provided. If the interim fina ncial statements include an interim balance Page | 7  sheet as of the corresponding interim date of  the preceding fiscal year, any material 
changes in financial condition from that date to the date of the most recent interim 
balance sheet provided also must be discussed. If discussions of changes from both the end and the corresponding interim date of the preceding fiscal year are required, the discussions may be combined at the discretion of the registrant.  (2) Material changes in results of operations.   
(i) Discuss any material changes in the registrant's results of operations with respect to the most recent fiscal year-t o-date period for which a statement of 
comprehensive income is provided and the corresponding year-to-date period of the preceding fiscal year.  (ii) Discuss any material changes in the registrant's results of operations with respect to either the most recent quarter for which a statement of comprehensive 
income is provided and the corresponding quarter for the preceding fiscal year or, 
in the alternative, the most recent quarter for which a statement of comprehensive income is provided and the immediately preceding sequential quarter. If the latter immediately preceding sequential quarter is discussed, then provide in summary form the financial information for that immediately preceding sequential quarter 
that is subject of the discussion or identify the registrant's prior filings on EDGAR that present such information. If there is a change in the form of presentation from period to period that forms the basis of comparison from previous periods provided pursuant to this paragraph, the registrant must discuss the reasons for changing the basis of comparison and provide both comparisons in the first filing in which the change is made.  
 Instructions to paragraph (c):  1. If interim financial statements are presented together with 
financial statements for full fiscal years, the discussion of the interim financial information must be prepared pursuant to this paragraph (c)  and the discussion of the full 
fiscal year's information must be prepared pursuant to paragraph (b)  of this section. Such 
discussions may be combined. Instructions 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 11 to paragraph (b)  of this 
section apply to this paragraph (c) .  
2. The registrant's discussion of material chan ges in results of operations must identify 
any significant elements of the registrant's income or loss from continuing operations which do not arise from or are not necessar ily representative of the registrant's ongoing 
business.

 I make a living advising commercial customers on energy management solutions.  In 2009 when I started my company, going green was thrown around by larger entities to get brownie points for being environmentally conscious.  Many of them bragged about going green, when all they did was purchase RECs to offset their emissions.  Now, Im not saying dismissing the purchase of RECs to go green, what I am saying is they viewed the image of being environmentally conscious as most important because it helped their business.  The key word here is image.  Today, companies still brag on their carbon footprint and the plans they have of becoming more energy efficient.  Consumers and investors care about the environment now more than ever and it is only right that companies are required to come forth more detailed information about their carbon footprints.  The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures to Investors provides a baseline requirement for disclosing climate-related
  information about a companys intentions of becoming energy efficient.  It requires the companies to define their goals and report on the progress.  It also requires the to report on GHGs which is directly related to the CAA.  So a potential investor can not only see just how a company is performing to goal, but they can also be made aware of the companys efforts on following regulations of the CAA.  A conscious investor can do their due diligence and determine how the company measures up to the CAA restrictions.  This is certainly important from a risk perspective.

No longer will companies be able to boast about their carbon footprint without explaining details.  The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures to Investors will remove the social image aspect of climate-change and will hold more companies accountable for their approach to reducing greenhouse gases.  This is a step in the right direction.  The next step is to require companies to openly (public) report on their emissions and confirm that they are in compliance with EPA regulations.  Most of the time, consumers dont hear about bad behavior until it makes the news.
Lastly, the only reasonable argument against this new rule is there may be an added cost associated with producing more information as the rule requires companies to hire a third party to conduct the analysis.  The argument lacks substance because they already spend money on the production on those reports.  I would assume, if they are an investible company, they already pay for quite a bit if the information the rule is requiring.  The rule will now require it to be made public."

 I like that it would create transparency and the ability to compare 'apples to apples on a company's risk exposure and greenhouse gas emissions to make the best decision for themselves. I think this makes complete sense and aligns with other requirements of filing with the SEC to provide investors with the information needed to make the best investment decision. I am particularly supportive of Scope 2, which will require a registrant would be required to disclose GHG emissions from upstream and downstream activities in its value chain. This approach provides more visibility into the full impact of business operations on the environment. However, I'd like to see some improvement or clarification around requirements for existing registrants. They should be held to the same standard as new registrants and given a certain period - maybe one year, to produce the report.

There is also an opportunity to add clarification around Scope 2 - I think including a complete 'cradle-to-grave audit of the supply and, especially the transportation effects are critical to understanding the true impact of the business. This suggested approach could mirror that of the RCRA requirements for manifest reporting. I strongly believe that the 'transportation aspect should be required because transportation is the most significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions."

 I believe this new proposed amendment to the Securities Act and Exchange Act would benefit all parties involved in the process. Having an industry submit information on what their proposed impact would be on the climate will help in the regulation process. Not saying I want to shut down businesses or anything like that but more industries need to own up to the impact they can have on the environment and climate. It also will help industries realize the added expense to treat and equalize their emissions. A good incentive for companies that provide this information would be tax breaks for not only submitting the information but for showing how they plan to regulate the emissions and give back to the environment. By providing information on climate related risks it would allow the government and permitting authority to better help prevent further damage to the environment. For example if an industry discharges wastewater from and industrial process like can making it could provide the
  government with information as to the type and amount of metals discharged in mg/L and this would tell the government about certain issues that could arise in the receiving stream. Many industries might feel like this is just another government overreach but I feel like it is a necessary tool for everyone to use and to help combat climate change. If the government doesnt charge a fee for the submitted information and make it voluntary then it could go over better with industries however a lot of industries might not comply if it is not mandatory. That goes back to providing incentives for industries that comply. Maybe they can get some kind of financial backing to provide information on these matters. All in all I think it is a good idea for industries to submit this information. It will only help everyone fight the climate battle and bring more attention to needed areas of funding for protecting the environment and climate."

 Dear Chairman Gensler,

I wholeheartedly support S7-10-22 \""The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors.\""

The science is clear that human activity has contributed to climate change and that in the last few decades alone the measurable impact of this change has increased to an untenable level.

It is encouraging that more publicly-traded companies are making commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and making \""Net Zero\"" pledges as part of their stated ESG goals.

It is also encouraging that investors from large institutional investors and sovereign funds to individual investors from \""Mainstreet USA\"" are increasingly interested in investing in companies that make these types of commitments.

However, more clarity and more requirements are needed to ensure that investors who wish to invest in sustainable companies are doing so and not dealing with companies that are simply making empty claims or that \""greenwash\"" their actual carbon footprint.

I support any effort to make disclosures \""consistent, comparable, and reliable\"" as the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures has recommended.

This proposal discusses the effect of the disparate frameworks for measuring GHG reductions. I agree with the SEC choosing one standard (GHG protocol's) and would suggest that the SEC and by extension the U.S. do all that it can to promote this standard internationally. Given our economic influence on the world, we can do much to ensure our chosen standard is adopted worldwide, similar to how GAAP accounting standards are widely recognized.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

Glenn Oyoung"

What you like about the Rule, and why.-  What I like about the rule is it is pretty much straight forward as it explains the (Exchange Act) that would require registrants to provide certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports.   The proposed rules would require information about a registrants climate- related risk that are reasonable likely to have a material impact on its business, results of operation, or financial condition. The required information about climate-related risk would also disclose of green house gas emissions, which have become a commonly used metric to assess a registrants exposures to such risks. In addition, under the proposed rules, certain climate- related financial metrics would be required in a registrants audited financial statements.( federalregister.gov) Therefore, this rule would require registrants climate risk in history, future or present that could possibly be a threat or damage human life and that is why I agree with this rule.  Where you see room for improvement, and why.- There is always room for improvement as in the area of make the rules and acts more clear and understanding. Too much jargon.  What clarifications, if any, you would like to see.- Too much jargon. Who actually does the reports and makes the acts/ rules final? Clarification on step by step on the process of how all this is completed and done and post the scientific data from the past and future predictions. More clear understanding. Simple terms."

 \""The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures to Investors.\""

- What I like about the Rule.

GHG emissions metrics could be useful in helping investors assess risk, and I applaud the efforts to provide relevant investors with disclosure information.
I observed that the rule states that the objective of this disclosure is not to drive targets, goals, plans, or conduct, but rather to provide investors with the tools to assess the implications of any targets, goals, or plans on the registrant when making investment or voting decisions. This is essential for a healthy economy and a sustainable future.

- Where I see room for improvement.

There is no specific protocol mandated by the proposed rule, so there could be confusion since not all companies could follow the same standard for measuring results.
By making uniform disclosures across all industries, issuers cannot mislead investors or get a greenwashed advantage over their competitors.
By enabling investors, analysts, reporters, and the Commission to compare companies' most verifiable and direct climate impacts, it will be harder for companies to misrepresent their impact. A great deal of public information is already available about the multiple products of a single industry, such as the automobile industry. Creating reporting that is more effective and comprehensive will make the truly distinct aspects of reporting better. They will be more meaningful to investors because they will be presented in a distinct way, and therefore the goals will be easier to achieve. Investors can and will use this information in evaluating an issuer's climate narrative disclosure.
I recommend taking a voluntary approach because investors and companies in high-risk industries are likely to drive innovation. A company that is willing to take challenging and uncertain steps toward cutting edge innovation should not be penalized for doing so or held accountable for not complying with all the established sustainability goals.

- What clarifications, if any, would I like to see.

I would like to have more clarification on how the rule could be implemented in the early years, how companies would be educated about how to implement the reports, and how facilitation would be provided.
Additionally, I would like to know how the registrant plans to achieve its climate-related goals and transition plan."

I'm a mother who is angry about the lack of action on climate.

I'm writing today to commend you for your recent decision to require the largest corporations to disclose their climate risks.

This rule is a huge step forward. By requiring massive companies to account for their carbon the same way they account for their cash, you are not only acknowledging that environmental destruction is a major financial risk, but also that the future of our planet is just as important (indeed, far more so) than corporate profits.

I echo the words of Ilmi Granoff, director of Sustainable Finance at the Climateworks Foundation, on this rule: ""It's awesome, it's very cool, and it's long overdue.""

Thank you for delivering this great victory for our planet and its people over profits, and please continue to take action to combat corporate greenwashing and help ensure the true costs of corporate pollution are accounted for.

 I like that this rule would provide a standardized approach to climate-related disclosures to the investor on the topics of climate control efforts and greenhouse gas emissions that would allow them to make more informed decisions regarding risks. Now, more than ever, investors are evaluating companies climate-change efforts for financial risks and moral standing.

What this rule may mean for the future beyond the SEC:
(1) If approved, the streamlined approach and transparency of reporting greenhouse gases may provide for advancements in technology that can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases produced in various industries.
(2) Greenhouse gas reporting may also lead to the adoption of greenhouse gases as a criteria pollutant in the Clean Air Act (CAA). This adoption would set limits on greenhouse gas production.

Although regulating companies to provide greenhouse gas emissions annually provides streamlined data to the investor as an additional evaluation tool to analyze investment risks, this requirement seems to be an overreach of authority. The SEC is responsible for protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation requiring companies to provide emission reports falls outside the scope of SECs responsibility. The SEC should allow for the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emission reporting via the CAA. If greenhouse gas emissions are to be shared with investors, why not let companies furnish emission reports to investors rather than file emissions reports with the SEC?

Additionally, this requirement would require companies to bear the cost of monitoring and testing for greenhouse gas emissions. Ultimately, this cost would fall on investors. Since 2010, the SEC has required companies to disclose climate change related information. Instead of regulating the requirement of greenhouse gas emissions reporting, why not streamline the way climate change related information is provided to the SEC? Any streamlined approach to seeing uniform data would help the investor take calculated risks."

Hi, 


Climate change impacts so much, including my retirement and savings.  I will need to start to draw from my investments in the next 6 or so years.  It’s important for me to know what companies are polluting and which companies are trying to do the right thing when it comes to the environment.  Transparency is critical for individuals to make decisions about which companies are making climate change worse.  The SEC is supposed to protect investors not polluters.   


Please protect individuals, not companies that are trying to conceal their polluting habits. 


Sincerely, 


Pamela Langer"

Dear Chair Gensler,  


I am writing to thank you for taking steps to make it easier for investors like me to understand climate risk.  Like many middle-class Americans, I have a large part of my retirement savings in stock market funds.  As an investor wanting good returns and stability in my investments, I need to know whether or not a company is preparing to be successful in a low-carbon world. More and more economies are adopting policies and taking steps to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement.  Companies not working to reduce their Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse emissions may not be prepared for that future, which is more and more clearly approaching. Without clear disclosure on emissions, I won't be able to tell what companies are likely to continue to be profitable as the economy transitions to clean energy and which companies could put my savings at risk.  Similarly, managers of mutual funds and pension funds won't be able to evaluate companies and choose appropriate investments. 


Earlier this summer you proposed a rule to require publicly traded companies to disclose ""material"" Scope 3 emissions. Many investors - both asset managers and individual investors like me - asked you to make this a requirement for all large public companies, and I am hopeful that you will listen to the voices of regular people like me, not just big corporations looking to hide their risks.  As you look to finalize these rules, I wanted to thank you for doing everything in your power to ensure that investors like me have the information we need to be able to make smart investing decisions for a low-carbon future. I am looking forward to seeing strong greenhouse gas disclosures, inclusive of Scope 3 emissions, in your final ruling later this year.

I am writing to thank you for taking steps to make it easier for investors like me to understand climate risk. As an investor, I'm very concerned about the economic impacts climate change is already having. As the effects of climate change grow, those impacts could increasingly affect economic growth and the retirement savings of millions. 


When I evaluate an investment, I need to know if a company is taking steps to be successful in a global economy that is decarbonizing. Companies that aren't working to reduce their Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions won't be ready for that future. Without this information, I won't know which companies are likely to continue to be profitable as the economy transitions to clean energy and which companies could put themselves, the planet, and my savings at risk.

Every day, I see how climate change is affecting me financially, and therefore, not just my lifestyle and comfort and health, but my children and most importantly my grandchildren and their lifestyles, comfort, health and in fact, their very future existence. 

Today, I listened to an interesting analysis of what various corporations and financial stakeholders are doing to address climate change eliminate practices that are increasing the risks to human life as well as the rest of life on earth that occur when those entities cause pollution of various kinds (air, water, and soil primarily). 
A large portion of my retirement income has come from our investments in various stocks, and we are concerned 

about having information that can wisely influence our choices in this area. We need to know that we are not personally and financially contributing to increasing the risks our children and grandchildren will face after we are gone as inhabitants of our planet Earth. 

We urge the SEC to limit investment in companies who do not reduce practices that increase pollution and slow the progress so many responsible companies have made toward mitigating negative climate change effects. Transparency is crucial for making those decisions. Please make future decisions about investment based on responsible corporate and company practices in regard to climate risk and climate change, and increase investment in companies and corporations that share that information openly. 

Thank you.

I am writing to thank you for taking steps to make it easier for investors like me to understand climate risk. 

I am counting on my financial investments providing most of my retirement income that will be needed in a couple of decades. I need a maximum amount of disclosure about emissions to help me determine which investments will have minimal impact on the planet and global climate change so that I can feel secure knowing my choices today will support companies that will be strong in the low-carbon energy future that we must achieve. In order to make smart choices, I want the knowledge to know what companies are working diligently to reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse emissions. 

Please make it a requirement that all large public companies disclose their Scope 3 emissions. Without this information, I won't be able to tell what companies are likely to continue to be profitable as the economy transitions to clean energy. 

As you look to finalize these rules, I wanted to thank you for doing everything in your power to ensure that investors like me have the information we need to be able to make smart investing decisions for a low-carbon future. I am looking forward to seeing strong greenhouse gas disclosures, inclusive of Scope 3 emissions, in your final ruling later this year.

Thank you for your efforts to make investments more transparent for private investors like me. I am very concerned about Climate Change and consider every decision I make using that criteria. I do not want to invest in companies that are adding to the problem or making no effort to improve the situation.
Please be aware of investors like me when finalizing relevant rules.

I am writing today to thank you for implementing changes to how companies disclose their greenhouse gas emissions. For me, it is extremely important to invest in companies that align to my values. I am passionate about protecting the planet and all species and I believe that we can protect the earth and continue to have a strong economy.

Companies not working to reduce their Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse emissions may not be prepared for that future.

This email is to express my deep concern for fate of the planet with climate change. Some companies are still not investing to encourage mitigation of the effects of climate change and to remain profitable as fossil fuel use wanes. Reducing carbon emissions is crucial for all entities of society including companies. I am asking that the recently proposed rule for companies to disclose Scope 3 emissions be made a requirement. This is important information for the many investors like me who are interested in climate change management for the good of the earth and the good of our investments.

I am concerned that the proposed rule will not provide adequate information to investors. My wife and I have our retirement savings primarily invested in stocks and mutual funds. Of course we rely on dividends and increasing value of our investments, but we are not ""only in it for the money"". We realize that our generation, and really everyone alive now, is obliged to live in such a way as to allow future generations to live well in a healthy environment. 
At this time it seems our activities are lowering the probability of that outcome and even lowering the quality of life right now! 
I realize that modern industry has made our amazing way of life possible, but it has come at a big price. Sadly those profiting find it in their interests to keep the public, and even their own investors uninformed about Environmental, Social, and worker related (ESG) issues. 
WeWant to know which companies are causing GHG emissions, which ones are working to lessen their impact and which aren't. Its not only climate change. Some companies create pollution that damages or even poisons their neighbors (and sometimes quite distant neighbors). I don't want to benefit from such investments. 
So you see, we need information about GHG emissions and other pollution in order to invest wisely, protect our 'nest-egg', and protect our children, grandchildren and future generations. 
This is an extremely serious situation, and if the SEC allows industry lobbyists and million- and billionaires to influence regulation and rules and limit information investors need you will be doing a cruel disservice to not just American investors but also everyone alive now and future generations! 
Please do the right thing.

Dear Chair Gensler,  


 I am writing to thank you for taking steps to make it easier for investors like me to understand climate risk.  Climate disruption may well be the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced.  If we don’t measure up to this crisis, future civilization may indeed collapse, or at the very least be severely damaged.  It is going to take a concerted effort on everyone’s part to secure the future and that is why it is extremely important that investors know where their money is going and how it is being used.  The SEC climate disclosure rules will be an essential aid to conscientious investors.  Please make sure that this information is available to current and future investors.   
Thank you for your concerted effort to secure the future for humanity.

I personally invest in an ESG mutual fund. But how can I know if I've made a ""good choice"" in the ESG fund I've chosen if there's no transparency on greenhouse gas emissions? The reason I've chosen to invest in an ESG fund is because I care deeply about transitioning not only the U.S. economy but the world to zero greenhouse gas emissions. I believe climate change is an existential threat to life on this planet. Arguably we are currently witnessing the 6th great extinction. Climate change is a ""big deal"". But I can't make wise choices if I can't get accurate information. That's why the SEC's decision in this matter is so important. Small investors like me need all the help we can get from the SEC in making investment decisions that align with our values and morals. Please take us into account when making this decision."

     Like so many people around the world, I feel concern for the state of the planet.  Climate change has been a major issue for forty years I read, and that the planet had been the warmest ever in the years 2016-2020.  It's not that in the past that I didn't keep an eye and ear open for news about climate change, but I wouldn't say I was the best person to sort out the cans from the plastics for the different trash cans.  Over the past two years, I believe it would be, I heard young and old over the television, make it clear how these generations are destroying the planet from the up and coming generations.  This is sad, but very true if this crisis isn't solved for all generations, now and in the future.  This struck a nerve in me when another documentary came on television, and while I was watching and listening, I saw I believe was a junior high student's pain or anger repeating how the planet is going to be destroyed before they have a chance to use it.  They shouldn't have to live this way.  They should be able to grow up naturally and be able to make mistakes, which is part of growing up also.  They most likely are stressed and don't know how to believe in the future as we did growing up.  But I want to help if I can or whatever possible with my solution.  Also I know you will have to run everything by your experts.          My solution is about the use for water to kill fire and smoke.  To do this you would need non-combustible rooms and or containers, water basins and a strong enough vacuum to suck up the smoke.  In the non-combustible room/container you would burn all the trash that we humans throw- away on a weekly basis.  The water basin would obviously be used to take down the fire.  But another basin with water can cause the smoke to go out because the water is obviously heavier than the smoke.  The smoke and it's emission are what we have learned to prevent from entering the atmosphere and ozone layer.  The vacuum part of the solution could pull the smoke into the water basins in a swirling motion to mix with the water.  Or water could drip on the smoke.  I don't know if you would place the water basins on top of the room/containers or side of them.  This part or the fire part could probably be done by the refuse department because they pick up the trash. Or maybe it's meant to be done by someonelse.        The second part of the solution could be dealt with by the sewage department.  I watched a documentary on how sewage is treated before being released into the sea and rivers.  I also heard how algae and forms like it, help filter pollutants from the oceans.  Maybe algae should be grown to take down our trash.  Maybe  it already is.  I'm thinking  this is for the experts.              But then the soot from the burning of the trash would be flushed like human waste or washed down drains.  This is definitely where I'm lost and experts really would know if this could work because I don't know how much the sea or river can handle even if the soot and sewage are pretreated.  Maybe some of the soot can be used in other things.  For example, I heard of repurposing recycled materials for manufacturing.  Or maybe the soot could be made into a water soluble material to be thrown away from the earth when we become overwhelmed if this doesn't work for you.  This shouldn't  contaminate anyone or anything underneath us if there is anything there.  This use of smoke into water could be used for chimney use also.   Place a water basin on top or side of a house. Let the smoke blow through or is pulled by the vacuum into the water basin.  The same could be done for barbacue pits, smokers and maybe car exhaust pipes.  Maybe all then is needed is to empty the dirty water from an aparatus.  I hope this helps.                                                                                                             Thank you, Andrea Taylor"

Dear Chair Gensler, 


I am reaching out to you today as an environmentalist AND a concerned investor. Specifically, I am asking you not to back down on climate disclosure rules, but, rather, to protect them. The steps you’ve taken to make it easier for investors like me to understand our climate risk in our portfolios are so important, and I would like to see strong greenhouse gas disclosures in your final ruling later this year.  


Transparency from financial institutions about their GHG emissions is going to become increasingly critical for investors as the world and the market adjust to a warming climate. I don’t want to invest in companies that are disproportionately contributing to global warming — not just because I don’t want my money supporting polluters, but ALSO because I just don’t consider it a sound financial decision. As we make a global transition to clean energy, companies who are failing to reduce their scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse emissions are quickly going to be at a disadvantage and a bad investment.  


It is unfair to keep concerned people like me in the dark about the climate risk of the corporations we invest our money in. This stuff just shouldn’t be shrouded in mystery, at this point. There’s too much at stake, both financially and environmentally.  


Thank you for the important work you’ve been doing on this issue, and please continue to fight for the rights of people, not polluters.

Dear Chair Gensler,

Thank you for making it easier for citizens to understand climate risks and what we can do to mitigate them.

It is important for all to know how much damage big polluters are doing, not only from an investment standpoint but also, more importantly, just because we want to have a planet we can live on comfortably into the future.  Please continue your work to protect the 90%+ of this planet that is not a big corporation.  Doing so will have financial and human benefits!!

Sincerely,

Diana Dundore, a very concerned citizen"

Dear Chair Gensler, 
I am writing to thank you for taking steps to make it easier for investors like me to understand climate risk. I retired from the SEC in 2014, but during my thirty-seven years with you I was impressed with the essentiality of investors having access to material information.  Although much of our retirement comes from the Thrift Savings Plan, as well as the Civil Service Retirement system for us old-timers, the TSP has a number of funds which investors can choose in allocating their money, and these funds are invested in underlying securities.  In choosing among fund, or in making other investment decisions outside of these funds, investors like me want material information about the companies in which we have our money invested.  
As an investor looking to maximize my returns, I need to know whether or not a company is preparing to be successful in a low-carbon world. More and more economies are adopting policies and taking steps to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Companies not working to reduce their Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse emissions may not be prepared for that future. Without this information, I won't be able to tell what companies are likely to continue to be profitable as the economy transitions to clean energy and which companies could put my savings at risk. 
I personally trust the assessments of scientists that climate change is real and our progress in eliminating or minimizing greenhouse gases will have an impact on the future of our world.  I also recognize that some people don’t accept the severity or reality of climate change information.  Either way, information about the way companies are reacting is material to their effect on our world and the profits they do and don’t make as a result of these decisions.  I recognize that sometimes more fossil fuels may be needed short-term, as for the crisis situation in Europe cause by the war in Ukraine, but either way investors deserve the maximum information to navigate our turbulent waters.  
Earlier this summer you proposed a rule to require publicly traded companies to disclose ""material"" Scope 3 emissions. Many investors - both asset managers and individual investors like me - asked you to make this a requirement for all large public companies, and I am hopeful that you will listen to the voices of regular people like me, not just big corporations looking to hide their risks.

Dear Chair Gensler,  


Thank you for taking steps to make it easier for investors like me to analyze what companies are doing to limit their exposure to climate risks.  


I am an investor that is very concerned about climate change and what companies are doing to prepare for it. My wife, children and grandchildren are depending on me. 


It is critically important to see a company's ESG ratings before I invest in it, and also see the Environmental and Social ratings of index funds and mutual funds.  I need to know whether  a company is preparing to be successful in a low-carbon world. More and more economies are adopting policies and taking steps to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Without this information, I won't be able to tell which companies are likely to continue to be profitable as the economy transitions to clean energy and which companies could put my savings at risk. 


It is also important that the SEC establish consistent rules for the measurement of Environmental, Social, and Governance metrics that third-party certifiers can follow so that companies and funds can be fairly compared.  



Thank you for considering my comments and concerns.

Dear Chair Gensler,  


Thank you for trying to implement a system so investors like me can better assess the risks posed by companies contributing to the climate crisis. As an investor, I need to know how companies I invest in are moving forward to reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse emissions in alignment with the Paris Agreement and prepare for a low-carbon future. Without the rule from the SEC requiring publicly traded companies to disclose material Scope 3 emissions, I won't be able to properly assess which companies will continue to be profitable in this new environment. Many have asked you to require this disclosure for all large public companies and I hope that you will listen not just to the big corporations trying to hide their risks but to regular, young investors like me with deep concerns about our future.   


Thank you for pushing to make sure investors have the information they need to make smart choices in their portfolios. In your final ruling, I really hope to see you include strong carbon emission disclosures. Our wallets and the liveability of the world as we know it depend on it.

I am largely living on investment income and would very much like to be better informed about the energy consumption and environmental degradation caused by companies with whom I have investments.
 
As a committed environmentalist, I want my money used for activities that do not drive climate change. Of course, I am concerned about the impact of significant weather events on retirement income. It seems to me that the SEC has a significant role to play in educating the public about what large American companies are doing.

Dear Chair Gensler,
I am writing to thank you for taking steps to make it easier for investors like me to understand climate risk.
With the way the climate is worsening I need to do everything I can to change it for the better.  To do that I need to know everything I can about the climate impacts of my investments. 

As an investor looking to maximize my returns, I need to know whether or not a company is preparing to be successful in a low-carbon world. More and more economies are adopting policies and taking steps to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Companies not working to reduce their Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse emissions may not be prepared for that future. Without this information, I won't be able to tell what companies are likely to continue to be profitable as the economy transitions to clean energy and which companies could put my savings at risk.
Earlier this summer you proposed a rule to require publicly traded companies to disclose ""material"" Scope 3 emissions. Many investors - both asset managers and individual investors like me - asked you to make this a requirement for all large public companies, and I am hopeful that you will listen to the voices of regular people like me, not just big corporations looking to hide their risks.
As you look to finalize these rules, I wanted to thank you for doing everything in your power to ensure that investors like me have the information we need to be able to make smart investing decisions for a low-carbon future. I am looking forward to seeing strong greenhouse gas disclosures, inclusive of Scope 3 emissions, in your final ruling later this year.

Dear Chair Gensler, good afternoon–

I am an investor, follow the market, am a minority, fear the lack of responsibility towards climate crisis, and hope to mitigate it.

Investors seek to maximize returns, but even more important than gaining returns, is the opportunity required to spend it, which requires a planet not suffering thru an dystopian apocalypse.

Investors MUST know whether or not a company is preparing to be successful in a low-carbon world.

Investors MUST know who is aligning to the Paris Accord, AND who is failing.

Companies not working to reduce their Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse emissions may not be prepared for that future. Without this information, I won't be able to tell what companies are likely to continue to be profitable as the economy transitions to clean energy and which companies could put my investments & savings at risk.

Please proceed with the previously proposed Rule to require publicly traded companies to disclose ""material"" Scope 3 emissions.

All large public companies MUST have this in order to provide visibility to the public at large.

Thank you for accepting my comment, and doing everything in your power to ensure that investors have the information required to be able to make smart investing decisions for a low-carbon future.
We must all work together in this.

Scope 3 emissions are some of the most important low level information an investor could have. I sincerely hope your final ruling includes this.

Thank You & your Staff, for your time and consideration in this matter.

As an investor I want to know whether or not a company I am investing in is preparing to be successful in the lower carbon world that is our future!  I will not invest in big companies and corporations that will not align their goals with the Paris Agreement goals.  

Companies that are not seriously working to reduce their Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions will not be prepared for the future.  Without this information I won't be able to make informed decisions about where my investments should be. And I will not know whether the companies I invest in will continue to be profitable as the economy transitions to clean energy.  Putting my RETIREMENT funds and LIFE SAVINGS at risk.

Dear Chair Gensler, 


As an investor, corporate transparency is very important to me. I appreciate that you are taking steps to strengthen disclosure rules so that I will know if a company is actually working to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Without disclosures, we will have no way of knowing if our investments and retirement will be jeopardized by companies who are continuing to pollute. We do not want to be investing in big polluters or companies that are not working to improve our climate and we cannot know if you don't require them to be transparent. 


Please listen to regular people like me and not just to corporations.  


Please strengthen and do not water down your transparency requirements regarding climate change. I am looking forward to seeing strong greenhouse gas disclosures in your final ruling later this year.

As I approach retirement age, I'm very concerned that the investments that are widely available are still not required to disclose the amount of greenhouse gases or other global warming pollutants they discharge into the atmosphere based on their ongoing operations.   


There needs to be much more climate warming potential disclosure on the part of these companies and the funds that support them.  As a concerned citizen, I would like the SEC to exercise their powers to require these companies to be more forthright in these disclosures, and the SEC has the power to require this from these funds.   


I want to know this so that I can securely choose companies that do not contribute to the overall global warming that is still ongoing and will be for some time in the future.  I have children that will be growing up in this world far beyond when I leave this world, and it's not fair that they have to endure the burden of an inhospitable world largely because we didn't hold these companies and the funds that support them accountable for their actions.

I am one of the lucky ones, already 75 years old, so I have mostly been able to enjoy a benign climate throughout my life, but I am very concerned about the environment my younger nieces, grand nieces, and nephew and grand nephew will inherit.

They, like me, have had the benefit of good educations and are in an excellent position to understand the threats some businesses pose to our environment for them and their children in turn.

My generation of Baby Boomers thought we were changing the world for the better, but, sadly, the rise of Cutthroat Capitalism since Nixon, Regan, and especially Trump seems to be working for the destruction of all in favor of short-sighted financial benefit for the few.

Please follow and strengthen YOUR job of keeping the people of this country informed about what large corporations are doing so we and our progeny can fight them for the benefit of all living and breathing beings on this planet.

The issue of companies claiming assets valued without estimating the risk that so-called ""reserves"" may be unusable in future may well mislead investors like me, when the companies likely will provide more correct information to lenders. I vote my stocks to encourage less burning of fossil fuels because of the climate change that creates. But the boards are not transparent about the impacts on future plans and incomes, nor am I sure they are making plans to protect the environment by pursuing better ways of providing energy and doing business.

Dear Chair Gensler, 

I am a political investor. My politics as an investor are environmental.  
I want to know what certain companies are doing and not doing to protect our planet. I want to know if facts are being hidden or exaggerated in order that my money is being used wisely. You can help me with that. Please keep a tight rein on regulations that keep investors informed. 
As a scientist and member of the public, my politics are environmental also. 
I want my conscience to be clear knowing that I have chosen investments that will help the world not help bring it down. 
If companies are complaining, and I'm sure they are, about tight regulations, then these companies need to be looked at for what they are hiding. If you want to be able to get away with lying about one thing, chances are they are already lying about other things. 
Keep them honest. 
Thank You. 
Sincerely, 
H.L. Chris Chrissos

Dear Chair Gensler, I am writing to thank you for taking steps to make it easier for investors like me to understand climate risk.  



As an investor looking to maximize my returns, I need to know whether or not a company is preparing to be successful in a low-carbon world. More and more economies are adopting policies and taking steps to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Companies not working to reduce their Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse emissions may not be prepared for that future. Without this information, I won't be able to tell what companies are likely to continue to be profitable as the economy transitions to clean energy and which companies could put my savings at risk. 


Earlier this summer you proposed a rule to require publicly traded companies to disclose ""material"" Scope 3 emissions. Many investors - both asset managers and individual investors like me - asked you to make this a requirement for all large public companies, and I am hopeful that you will listen to the voices of regular people like me, not just big corporations looking to hide their risks.

Dear Chair Gensler,  
I join all those writing to thank you for taking steps to make it easier for investors like me to understand climate risk.  


Of course all investors are looking to maximize returns, so we all need to know whether or not a company is preparing to be successful in a low-carbon world. More and more economies are adopting policies and taking steps to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement. However, some companies not working to reduce their Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse emissions; they may not be prepared for that future. Without this information, I can't determine what companies are likely to continue to be profitable as the economy transitions to clean energy-- and which companies could put my investments at risk.

I have struggled, as an investor, to orient my retirement portfolio toward sustainability and environmentally responsible companies.  I strenuously support the ideals and goals of this petition.  We clearly have reached the point in global warming where the catastrophic impacts are upon us in terms of extreme weather events (wind, flooding, fire, heat).  The only recourse to preventing more extreme weather events is very proactive environmental protections.

I need to comment on the proposed rule to evaluate publicly held companies based on their ESG ratings. I believe it is wrong for the following reasons.
 
I invest in companies based on their abilities to generate money for me legally and ethically, not based on any other criteria. It puts undue costs on most companies, especially smaller companies that would be required to track and report the data. It makes it difficult for financial advisors to meet their fiduciary responsibilities to me as a customer. My assets including a large part of my life savings are being used to push a political agenda that I don’t necessarily support.

RE: Comment Submission on Securities and Exchange Commission Proposed Rule, File Number S7 -10-22: 
The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate -Related Disclosures for Investors  
The Center for Negative Carbon Emissions (CNCE) appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on 
the Securities and Exchange Commission Proposed Rule  to enhance and standardize climate -related 
disclosures for investors.  The CNCE is a research center at Arizona State University focusing on 
advancing carbon management science, technology, and policy to manage climate change.  We hope to 
bring Chairman Gary Gensler and the Commission  valuable context from the perspective of climate 
science and carbon management.  
The IPCC’s most recent report makes clear that to limit global warming to the commitments 
made under the Paris Agreement, world emissions must stay within a finite allowance ( i.e., a remaining 
carbon budget). Operating within this finite allowance means emissions must either halt completely (go 
to zero) or emissions must be matched by neutralization (a balancing). Purchasing credits that represent 
emission reduction or avoidanc e does not neutralize (balance) an emission. The math makes that clear: 
an emission (1 ton) minus an emission avoided (0 ton) does not equal zero, it equals 1 extra ton. Since 
tackling the climate change problem requires staying within a finite budget, thi s extra ton debits from 
the account. Buyers of such avoidance or reduction credits that then claim to have scrubbed their 
emission ledger are in fact continuing to contribute to climate change, and thus increasing their (and 
everyone else’s) climate risk. The disclosure of the type of credit purchased would thus be a necessary 
step to meeting the public and climate -risk disclosure targets explored by the SEC.  
While climate -related risk disclosure would in theory increase protection for investors, the 
approa ch to risk disclosure using an emission -based  life cycle assessment to carbon accounting is 
inadequate. The idea of tracking carbon through all supply chains to hold myriad businesses accountable 
for climate change is based on a sub -optimal approach to car bon management . Its history is rooted in an 
environmental discourse too timid to acknowledge that the release of carbon into the environment 
must stop completely  as previously described . Even if it were possible to equitably assign emissions to 
the appropr iate party, most businesses and end -consumers are in no position to fix the problem.  
As we submitted in a letter to the Economist, a  much better approach starts from the premise 
that most of the climate problem, ocean acidification, and carbon eutrophicat ion of the environment is 
caused by the massive release of excess carbon into the environment. Rather than spending futile 
efforts in tracing carbon through the supply chains, it would be much more effective to demand that the 
easily quantifiable extractio n of fossil carbon from the ground must be matched immediately by an 
equal amount of sequestration. If for every ton of carbon coming out of the ground another ton is 
stored safely and permanently, the extracted carbon is rendered harmless. Rather than pondering  over 
who is responsible for scope three emissions, a much better accounting framework  would focus on 
developing trustworthy certificates of sequestration  based on the initial extraction. Ideally the 
certificates would match the ton of carbon extract ed with a ton of carbon permanently sequestered. If the storage mechanism is time limited the storage operator would be responsible for replacing carbon 
lost from storage. Businesses downstream of the extraction would see the cost of carbon management 
and thus have an incentive to avoid fossil carbon if they can. This approach avoids the development of a 
large industry of carbon trackers and a large lobbying industry trying to convince the SEC  to shift the 
burden of carbon management somewhere else in the s upply chain.  
We are grateful for the leadership of Chairman Gensler and the Commission on this issue and 
appreciate the opportunity to contribute. Our hope is that, by requiring disclosure from the industries 
that can act on climate change, through an appr opriate carbon accounting framework, the SEC will 
generate the simplest, most complete , and actionable path towards stopping climate change.

 Recommendations  
 
I. Recommendations on Specific Disclosures and Provisions in the Proposed Rule   
GHG E missions D isclosure (page 43) 
Scope 1, 2, and 3 
• Disclosure of Scope 1 and 2 emissions should be required only if material  to the company. If 
required to be disclosed, Scope 1 and 2 emissions should be s ubject to  widely recognized de 
minimis  exceptions for immaterial subsets of categories of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. 
• Scope 3 emissions should be disclosed only on a voluntary basis regardless of material ity.3 If 
require d to be disclosed, Scope 3 should be subject to the longstanding materiality standard 
and the disclosure requirements should be clarified.  
• Smaller reporting companies should be exempted as to any Scope 3 emissions disclosure 
requirements.  
Targets and Goals  (pages 21, 49) 
• GHG emissions and climate -related target/goal setting disclos ure should be required only if 
material to the company and publicly announced.  
• Disclosure about progress towards a target or goal should only be required if such progress is material to the company  and should be principles- based . 
• If not subject to a materiality standard, GHG emissions and climate -related target/goal setting 
disclosure should be required only at a high level.  
• If not subject to a materiality standard, the rule should provide an exception consistent with the SEC’s previously established rules with respect to information that is not known and not available without unreasonable efforts or expense ( e.g., Rule 409 of the Securities Act and 
Rule 12b-21 of the Exchange Act). 
Disaggregation (page 51)  
• Disclosure of disaggregated  GHG emissions should be required only if and to the extent an 
issuer already publicly discloses such aggregated data elsewhere and if material.  
Disclosure Timing  (page 51) 
• Given that most companies don’t have the proposed climate data when their Form 10 -Ks are 
due, the data should be reportable later in the year ( e.g., 180 days after FYE ) on a specially 
 
3 Of the 10 largest U.S. asset manager s’ comment letters analyzed by Morningstar, just one of the eight that 
submitted a standalone comment letter to the SEC supported mandatory disclosure of Scope 3 emissions at present. 
The top 10 list include s Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity Investments, Capita l Group, State Street, T. Rowe Price, 
Invesco, JPMorgan, Franklin Templeton, and Dimensional.  See Morningstar, Climate Disclosures: Not Quite as 
Easy as (Scope) 1 -2-3 ( Jul. 2022)  (“Only one manager, Capital Group, favors mandatory disclosures of other 
indirect greenhouse gas  emissions (Scope 3) at this time. The others are opposed to making such disclosures 
mandatory,  citing a lack of maturity in measurement methods and an absence of materiality for many companies.”). 
At least one of the other top 10  asset managers covered by the article that did not submit a standalone comment 
letter  participated in a trade group letter that supported voluntarily- only disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions . 3 
 designated  form to be furnished with the SEC . Alternatively, companies should be permitted 
to report the data once available and verified on the next appropriate Form 10- Q or 10- K.4 
GHG Protocol  (pages 33, 55)  
• The GHG emissions -related methodologies should align with those of th e GHG Protocol .  
• Organizational and operational boundaries for reporting GHG emissions should be  
permitted to align with GHG Protocol or GAAP if the election is identified and the rationale  
explained.  
• The allowance to exclude emissions from investments that do not qualify for the equity 
method should be expanded to apply to investments that are not recorded under the equity method of accounting, regardless of whether they qualify. 
Governance D isclosures  (page 55)  
• Generally, the proposed strategy and risk management disclosures should be principles -based 
rather than prescriptive. Among other particulars, the proposed director climate expertise 
provision should be eliminated.
5 
• In lieu of the propos ed disclosures , which are overly granular and would indirectly regulate 
company behavior without regard to shareholders’ best interests, the SEC could update its  
2010 Climate Change Disclosure  Guidance to clarify that the current disclosure requirements 
in Reg ulation  S-K apply to climate -related issues  and to focus on industry- specific disclosure 
in recognition of the fact that not all companies are similarly situated when it comes to 
climate risk.  
• The SEC Division of Corp oration Fin ance could continue to use its sample comment letter  
process to evaluate compan ies’ compliance with the securities laws.  
• Any additional disclosure requirements  should be principles -based, for example, delineat ion 
of specific categories for disclosure rather than the proposed detailed, prescriptive disclosure 
requirements. Along these  lines, t he SEC could amend current Regulation S -K risk and 
governance disclosure requirements to add language to indicate that climate -related 
information must be disclosed. The SEC could amend the current Regulation S -K risk and 
governance disclosure requirements to add language to indicate that climate -related 
information must be disclosed ( e.g., Item 407(h) could expressly require disclosure of the 
board of directors’ oversight of climate -related risk).  
 
4 Based on member input, as discussed in our June 2022 comment letter on the proposed rule, the Society estimated 
that Scope  1 and 2 emissions data generally takes six months to generate, and that estimated Scope 3 data takes 
considerably longer to collect, analyze, and verify for reporting purposes to the extent feasible.  See supra note 1.    
5 According to Morningstar’s analysis of comment letters submitted by the 10 largest  U.S. asset managers, asset 
managers registered significant concerns with this proposed requirement.  See supra  note 3 at 13. ( “Both the ICI and 
several asset managers who co mment on this oppose the proposed disclosure  regarding climate expertise at board 
level. T. Rowe Price’s comment letter reflects the overall consensus:  ‘Although we support the requirement for 
enhanced transparency  around climate risk  governance, we recomm end eliminating the requirement that registrants 
identify if a board member has climate -related expertise and the process and frequency of board -level discussions.  
Single -issue expertise is not a quality that we have traditionally sought in board members,  preferring instead well -
rounded candidates who are able to contribute in multiple ways to a  company’s governance .”). At least one of the 
other top 10 asset managers covered by the article  that did not submit a standalone comment letter  participated in a 
trade group letter that requested elimination of the proposed climate expert director disclosure .

 • Companies should be permitted to provide board and management disclosures  in the proxy 
statement to avoid duplicative or isolated disclosure.  
Strategy and R isk M anagement D isclosures  (page 60)  
• The proposed strategy and risk management disclosures should be principles -based rather 
than prescriptive.  
• Disclosure of climate -related risks, including value chain- related climate risks, sh ould be 
limited to risks reasonably likely to materially impact a  company ’s financial statements and 
operations .  
• The zip code re quirement should be eliminated  and replaced with a less prescriptive, more 
principles -based, approach to the disclosure of physical risks .  
• In that a nalytical tools such as climate scenario analyses are likely to be competitively 
sensitive , the rule should provide for disclosure of the use of climate scenario analysis 
without requiring disclosure about detailed inputs, assumptions, parameters, and outputs. 
• If detailed disclosure is nevertheless required, the rule should allow companies to submit a 
streamlin ed form of confidential treatment request to the SEC with respect to such 
disclosures if the companies believe that the information may be competitively sensitive .  
• The rule should further provide a safe harbor given the nascent stage and ongoing developme nt of these climate scenario exercises.  
Regulation S -X (page 64)  
• The proposed requirement to include  climate -related metrics in the audited financial 
statements should be eliminated and replaced with an amendment to Item 303(b) of Regulation S -K that would require registrants to consider material climate -related impacts 
when discussing the results of operations, capital resources, and liquidity.  
• If climate -related metrics in the  financial statem ents are required , we recommend the 
following to make this  disclosure  feasi ble for companies:  
o The 1% threshold should be eliminated, and a principles -based materiality 
thresh old should be adopted instead.  
o The absolute value concept should be eliminated.  
o Consideration of “ lost revenue” and cost savings should be removed from any 
financial calculations .  
o “Financial impacts related to transition activities” should consider only those 
impacts that are entirely or primarily driven by a registrant’s efforts to mitigate climate -related transition risks . 
o FASB should be directed to provide further accounting guidance.  
o The proposed requirement to include climate -related metrics in the financial 
statements for historical periods should be eliminated .  
o Safe harbors mu st be adopted for forecasting information in financial statements .  
Assurance (pages 34, 71)  
• The assurance requirement should be eliminated .
6 If required, it should be phased in as 
suggested below.  
 
6 In our June 2022 comment letter on the proposed rule, the Society addressed, among other things, the prevalence 
among companies of obtaining third party assurance over GHG emissions data specifically, the assurance providers 5 
 Safe Harbors (page 74)  
 
• Companies  must be afforded appropriate safe harbors  to safeguard against meritless litigation 
over new climate disclosure.  
• The narrow safe harbor for Scope 3 emissions estimates provided in the proposal should be 
clarified and broadened to cover all of the new clim ate disclosures that would be required by 
the rule.  
• The rule should provide a safe harbor for climate expert directors like that proposed for cyber security  expert directors  in the SEC’s cyber disclosure proposal .
7  
Compliance Timeline (page 76)  
General  
• The SEC should adopt a sequential, layered phase -in schedule based on the degree of 
preparation, data, and external resources required for compliance , as suggested below:   
 
 
most commonly used for those c ompanies that obtain assurance (many of which may not meet the proposed rule’s 
independence and expertise requirements), the typically limited scope of assurance for those that obtain it, and the 
estimated costs  of assurance, which are expected to exceed current assurance costs and far exceed the estimated 
costs included in the Proposed Rule release. See supra note 1.     
7 See SEC, Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance, and Incident Disclosure, Release Nos. 33 - 
11038; 34 -943529; IC -34529, at 45-46 (Mar. 9, 2022). The Society did not support the proposed “cybersecurity 
expert director” provision contemplated by the March 2022  release for the same reasons  that it did not support the 
climate expert director provision in the P roposed Rule. See sup ra note 5.  6 
  
Acquired Businesses  (page 81)  
• The SEC  should provide additional phase -in accommodations with respect to acquired 
businesses :  
o A company should be permitted to omit acquired businesses  from its climate -related 
disclosures, including financial statement disclosures pursuant to the proposed 
amendments to Regulation S -X, until the commencement of the first reporting fiscal year 
that begins no sooner than 12 months after the effective date of the acquisition (s imilar to 
the temporary exemption from the requirement to include an acquired business in management’s report on ICFR ).  
o Climate- related financial statement disclosures for acquired businesses should not be 
required for historical periods preceding the first reporting fiscal year with respect to such acquired businesses.   
IPO Companies  (page 81)  
• All newly public companies  should be permitted an additional two -year phase- in period.  
Exemptions  
• Foreign private issuers and debt -only issuers should be exempt from the final rule.  
7 
 II. Global Issues  
Materiality  (page 9)  
• The disclosure requirements should be aimed at eliciting material information.  
• The definition of materiality should be consistent with the longstanding definition of 
materiality under the U.S. securities laws and Supreme Court precedent.8 
• The disclosure requirements should focus on the materiality of the information to a 
reasonable investor’s investment or voting decision for a particular company, not across an investor’s portfolio. 
• The disclosure requirements should be consistent with the time frames over which companies evaluate materiality.  
• The rule should not require or pressure companies  to disclose their  non- materiality 
determinations , whether with regard to Scope 3 emissions or otherwise. 
TCFD (page 31) 
• The Proposed Rule’s requirements should not exceed the TCFD recommendations.  
• Based on the nascent or non- existing state of TCFD disclosure for most companies as well as 
numerous other relevant factors, the proposed compliance schedule should be extended and 
layered as  suggested above.

Re:
Comment Submission on Securities and Exchange Commission Proposed Rule, File
Number S7-10-22: The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for
Investors
Deed is providing comments to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding
proposed rule “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for
Investors,” File Number S7-10-22. We are a social impact and employee engagement
technology platform used by over one million people and two million nonprofit organizations
worldwide. Our clients include Fortune 500s and fast-growing tech companies, alike in their
commitment to environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG). We hope to bring
Chairman Gary Gensler and the Commission valuable context from the corporate social
responsibility (CSR) practitioner’s perspective in their efforts to establish much-needed
consistency and comparability across our industry.
Commitment to Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG)
We read with great interest and care the many comments submitted since May. In our view, the
enthusiastic response from industry, government, and the public represents a summary
validation of ESG, both as an investment philosophy and as a daily practice for thousands of
responsible, successful companies.
Perspective: Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures
and Reporting Would Benefit All Stakeholders
Chairman Gensler notes that the proposal is “driven by the needs of investors and issuers.”
1
It is
a well-established fact that reporting on ESG initiatives does not yet meet a universal standard
of consistency and comparability of maximum use to investors and issuers.
We would add that the proposal’s adoption would benefit all stakeholders of publicly traded
companies, including employees, leadership, and consumers, all of whom are proven to thrive

Gensler, G., (2022). “Statement on Proposed Mandatory Climate Risk Disclosures”, U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission, 
https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-climate-disclosure-20220321
with greater clarity on companies’ ESG efforts;
2
whose thorough understanding of ESG would
tangibly impact companies’ climate initiatives;
3
and
whose assent would bolster confidence in
the long-term viability of virtually any security.
4
This year, we have learned that the majority of younger employees reaching senior-level
positions are prepared to leave their jobs if their companies do not make a tangible commitment
to social impact and environmental sustainability.
5
Additionally, 80 percent of CEOs predict that
investments in environmental sustainability will “improve their business results within five
years.”
6
Companies have known for at least eight years
that most consumers knowingly and
enthusiastically pay more for goods and services from companies making a social impact.
7
Conclusion
Deed welcomes the modernization and increased sustainability of the SEC’s approach to
market fairness, efficiency, and national capital formation that would follow this rule’s adoption.
We are grateful for the leadership of Chairman Gensler and the Commission on this issue, and
appreciate the opportunity to contribute to what will doubtless prove a broadly influential and
historic regulatory framework. Our hope is that, by establishing common-sense standards, the
SEC will generate ever-broader support for ESG and help responsible companies continue
working to solve the world’s most pressing issues.

RE: ESG Disclosures for Investment Advisors and Investment Companies "" (File No. S7-17-22)  
 
Dear Ms. Countryman:  
 
I welcome the opportunity to provide this comment letter in response to the Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking ""Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Disclosures for Investment Advisors 
and Investment Companies "" (File No. S7-17-22) (""Proposal"").  
 
I write in support of the rationale behind the Proposal to ensure that investors are provided with 
information that helps them understand the environmental, social and governance considerations 
included in a fund. That being said, I believe the final rule needs to improve upon this proposal in 
several areas, which I discuss below.  
 
Recommendations to strengthen the proposal  
 
Remove Fund Categories  
 
As drafted, the Proposal creates fund categories I believe the SEC staff will have trouble utilizing. 
The category into which a fund places itself determines the disclosures it would have to make under 
the Proposal. Integration Funds would be required to summarize in a few sentences how they 
incorporate ESG factors into the investment process, including which ESG factors they consider. 
ESG-Focused Funds (“Focused Funds”) would have much more extensive obligations. They would 
be required to identify in the ESG Strategy Overview summary table the ESG strategies it follows, 
such as screening, reliance on third-party data and ratings, and use of an index, as well as provide 
brief descriptions of how ESG factors are incorporated and how they vote proxies and/or engage 
with companies. The Proposal would also require Focused Funds to provide more detailed 
information about relevant strategies later in the prospectus. Impact Funds would have to disclose 
more extensive information, including the impact(s) it is pursuing, how it seeks to achieve the 
impact(s), how it measures impact and the time horizon over which impact is measured and 
tracked.  
 
The Proposal’s division of funds into three categories does not reflect the reality of how fund 
managers incorporate ESG factors in investment and stewardship decision-making, which could 
increase compliance costs. Sustainable investing strategies do not always fit neatly into an “ESG 
Integration” or “ESG Focused/Impact” box. The inconsistency between the discrete  
categories used in the Proposal and funds’ own approaches would create difficulty for funds seeking 
to determine which compliance regime applies to them, which in turn could impose compliance 
costs that are higher than those contemplated by the Release. I also believe that the majority of 
ESG-Focused funds are seeking specific outcomes or impacts so that having impact funds as a 
subset of ESG-Focused funds could be duplicative, particularly in the public markets – the market 
this proposal focuses on.   H E A VE NT R E E  L L C.  
3614 E Columbia Street  WA  98122  
Email. CareyZNYC@gmail.com     Phone. 707-722-7390   
 
The SEC should require all funds that consider ESG factors to disclose the same information to 
investors. Investors should be able to compare funds across ESG approaches. Further, eliminating 
the Proposal’s fund categories would simplify compliance, avoid investor confusion stemming from 
unequal disclosure across fund categories, and eliminate the incentive for funds to place 
themselves in the Integration Fund category to take advantage of its minimal disclosure 
obligations.  
 
I. All funds utilizing ESG criteria should disclose:  
a. An overview of fund strategy  
b. How the fund incorporates ESG criteria into investment decision making  
c. The use of 3 rd party data, scoring or ratings  
d. The use of an index and how the index uses ESG criteria  
e. The impact objective of the fund, if any  
f. How the fund engages with portfolio companies on ESG issues (including but not limited to 
the taxonomy of engagement activities outlined by the Impact of Equity Engagement 
Initiative)1 
g. If climate change is a significant or main consideration of the fund, disclose the 
greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint and the weighted average carbon intensity as defined in the 
Proposal 
 
 
Greenhouse gas emissions  
 
While, in principle, I support the greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions metrics, the SEC has not made 
a case for why this is the only ESG metric required in this proposal. I believe this needs to happen if 
it is to remain in the final rule. Additionally, the proposed requirement that Focused Funds, but not 
Integration Funds, disclose the Proposal’s standardized GHG emissions metrics likewise limits 
investors’ ability to compare funds across categories on this important dimension.  
 
Disclosures on engagement practices need improvement  
 
Shareholder engagement can be an important component of a fund manager’s sustainable 
investment strategy. Understanding what methods a fund manager uses in the engagement process 
with portfolio companies may give a more complete picture of the fund’s strategy.  
 
However, the Proposal oversimplifies the engagement process by requiring only one metric, the 
number of company meetings. The Impact of Equity Engagement Initiative (IE2) identified 14 
activities that shareholders use when engaging companies.2 It is my recommendation that the 
disclosures required on engagement practices should allow the fund managers to describe their 
engagement activities more broadly than the current proposal does.

The Proposal would require registered investment advisors to provide additional disclosures about 
their ESG strategies and methods of analysis. I believe these disclosures are already required in 
Part 2A of Form ADV 3 Sustainable or ESG investing is a strategy that advisors, should they use it 
with clients, already should be disclosing this information.

As many workers and Americans do, I invest in index funds to provide for my retirement and what will happen with Social Security is anyone’s guess. I am relying on the returns from my investments in index funds to get me through my retirement. One of the main reasons I choose to invest in index funds is due to the low costs of these funds. However, if the SEC adopts these amendments, the costs to the companies my index funds invest in will increase. These costs will come out of the returns shareholders receive. These costs will be very high to produce information that will not make any difference to me or how I invest. I am going to use my index funds to pay my expenses during retirement. This proposal adds needless costs onto companies and their shareholders that put my ability to support myself and family during retirement at great risk. Please do not adopt this proposal.

 Dear Countryman:

Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed rule for companies to disclose climate-related information to investors. I believe this is a good addition to the current reporting requirements that will ensure investors are receiving all material information needed to make decisions.

I appreciate the rules being formed around existing, proven standards like TCFD and GHG Protocol. I believe that consolidating the standards is crucial to reduce the challenges of gathering climate-related data.

I request that additional definitions be made on various requirements given in the proposal. Climate-related opportunities can be very subjective, and mean different things to different people. I believe that the reporting of opportunities should be standardized, and defined clearly for organizations. I appreciate that opportunities are made optional, as some organizations are not actively tracking them, but I believe if defined correctly, can help investors see more positive outcomes from organizations work in building more sustainable processes.

I also request that the requirements around disclosing scope 3 emissions be defined more clearly, specifically around the materiality. Scope 3 emissions are required to disclose if material, but without clear definitions, I believe many companies will categorize their scope 3 emissions as immaterial if at all possible, as the challenges of collecting that data make it more favorable to skip this reporting requirement.

In addition, I believe some leniency is required of organizations needing to report on climate-related risks in such detail. Currently, many public companies assess risks in a very qualitative manner. Asking companies to 1) integrate their climate-risk assessment process with enterprise risk management group, and 2) report in quantitative terms are sometimes in compatible, and very difficult to do, especially with the precision that is being required. I believe conducting scenario analysis and risk assessments on climate-risk drivers is critical, but requiring such detailed impacts on financial statements is extremely difficult for organizations to do, and will require massive investments, as many ERM programs can't provide that detailed information for their existing risks.

Thank you again for providing a method to respond to the proposal."

 Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,  
We appreciate the opportunity to provide comments in response to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission’s request for public input on The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate- Related 
Disclosures for Investors, F ile Number S7 -17-22.  
In response to thi s request, we would like to make the Commission aware of a study titled “ A theoretical 
framework for ESG reporting to investors ” that we are currently working on. We attach the study to our 
letter.  
In the study, we develop an analytical model to lay out th e effects of mandatory ESG reporting. Our 
study suggests that the mandatory disclosure of ESG outcomes has 4 discernable effects. First, there is a 
price reaction because investors are able to update their beliefs about the firm’s cash flows and the 
firm’s  ESG outcomes. Second, because of the price reaction, the ESG disclosure affects the activities that 
managers prefer to take. Third, because investors learn about the firms’ choices, the face less uncertainty, which manifests in a reduced expected future r eturn. Finally, while the price reaction to an 
ESG disclosure provides real incentives, it also provides incentives to manipulate the same disclosure. That is, firms have incentives to greenwash their ESG disclosures. Our study point out that greenwashing 
comes in different forms. On one hand, managers may directly alter the report. On the other hand, 
managers will shift efforts towards ESG components that are well measured and, in turn, shift efforts 
away from components that are not well measured.  
In the presence of these four effects, we compare different ways to aggregate the impact of managerial 
choices on the output of the firm. Here we compare a regime that measures ESG activities by their 
impact on the firm’s cash flows with a regime that m easures th e activities by their impact on the firm’s 
ESG output itself.  
We hope that you find the study useful for your deliberations and we appreciate the opportunity to 
provide this input.

Ph.D. Candidate Irina M. Luneva, University of Pennsylvania  A theoretical framework for ESG reporting to investors
Henry L. Friedman Mirko S. Heinle Irina Luneva
Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework for reporting of rmsenvironmental, social,
and governance (ESG) activities to investors. In our model, investors receive an ESG report
and use it to price the rm. Because the manager is interested in the rm s price, disclosing an
ESG report provides e¤ort and greenwashing incentives. We analyze the impact of di¤erent
reporting characteristics on the rm s price, cash  ows, and ESG performance. In particular,
we investigate the consequences of whether the report captures ESG inputs or outcomes, how
the report aggregates di¤erent ESG dimensions, and the manager s tradeo¤s regarding ESG
e¤orts and reporting bias. We nd that, for example, an ESG report that weights e¤orts by
their impact on the rm s cash  ows tends to have a stronger price reaction than an ESG
report that focuses on the ESG impact per se. ESG reports aligned with investorsaggregate
preferences provide stronger incentives and lead to higher cash  ows and ESG than reports
that focus on either ESG or cash  ow e¤ects individually. Additionally, in the presence of
informative nancial reporting, ESG reports that focus on ESG impacts lead to the same
cash  ow and better ESG results than reports focusing on cash  ow impacts alone.

1 Introduction
As concerns about climate change and social inequity become more widespread, consumers,
investors, and regulators are increasingly interested in rmsenvironmental, social, and gov-
ernance (ESG) activities. Information is a necessary input to the decisions that stakeholders
make. Investor and stakeholder pressure can motivate rms to shift activities towards those
more desirable from an ESG or cash- ow perspective, even when direct regulation of under-
lying activities is di¢ cult or infeasible. As a result, governments, industry bodies, and even
rms are developing standards for corporate ESG reporting. In many jurisdictions (e.g., the
U.S.), the reporting is targeted at investors, either because reporting to investors falls under
the purview of securities regulators, or because investors, as suppliers of capital, can demand
such disclosures.1We contribute to the ongoing development of ESG reporting research and
practice by providing a theoretical framework, highlighting economic forces that a¤ect the
impact of ESG reports used by investors.
Our framework is developed around a model of a rm that reports its ESG to investors.
Some investors incorporate ESG into their demand for shares, due to, for example, altruism, a
concern over ESG outcomes, or positive a¤ect (i.e., warm glow) from allocating wealth in line
with ESG. The rm s ESG and cash  ows depend on di¤erent corporate actions, and we allow
these actions to have heterogeneous e¤ects on ESG and cash  ows. We assume a manager
chooses the corporate actions (the manager s e¤ort, which can be alternatively interpreted as
investments in projects) to increase the rm s price and that investors are uncertain about
the manager s e¤ort choice because the manager s preference has a stochastic component
unobservable to outside investors.
ESG reporting entails a noisy public report of the rm s ESG activities, aggregating
1The European Union s Nonnancial Reporting Directive places some weight on information demands of
non-investor stakeholders, with reporting requirements targeted at both publicly listed rms as well as large
private rms.
1across e¤orts and aspects of ESG performance outside of the managerscontrol. The re-
porting weights on the e¤orts (and other variables) allow us to nest scenarios in which a
report measures the rm s ESG directly and those where a report measures the e¤ects of the
rmsESG choices on its expected cash  ows. The report is also subject to costly biasing
by the manager, which captures an aspect of greenwashing whereby rms manipulate their
ESG reports to appear green. Random variation in the reporting cost function prevents
investors from unraveling the biasing (as in Dye and Sridhar, 2004), which allows green-
washing to have a material e¤ect on price that does not depend on the manager passing the
cost of greenwashing on to investors (as in pure window-dressing models). Underpinning the
potential for harmful greenwashing are two stylized facts. First, investors are increasingly
concerned about rmsESG impacts (e.g., Pastor et al., 2021). Second, much of the data
on ESG is di¢ cult to measure (e.g., quality of jobs provided), or if easy to measure (e.g.,
smokestack emissions), di¢ cult to translate into dollar equivalents (e.g., e¤ect of smokestack
emissions on local and global welfare or cost of avoiding emissions).
Our framework suggests three alternative mechanisms through with ESG reporting can
a¤ect prices. First, because investors update their beliefs when information arrives, there is
an immediate price response. Second, ESG reporting has real e¤ects by changing managers
choices. Finally, when investors learn about the rm s activities from the ESG report, they
face less uncertainty about cash  ows and, as a result, demand a lower risk premium. All
three e¤ects are simultaneously determined in equilibrium. In particular, when investors
learn more from the ESG report, the price response will be stronger, managers will have
greater incentives to change their actions, and there will be a larger reduction in the risk
premium. At the same time, a stronger price response also provides more incentives to bias
the report. Additionally, as we discuss later, di¤erent investors may be interested in learning
di¤erent things from the same report, so a report that is more sensitive to, for instance,
ESG outcomes unrelated to cash  ows, may be viewed as more informative to ESG-minded
investors but noisier to investors focused on learning about cash  ows.
2An important feature of ESG reporting is greenwashing, whereby rms present positively-
biased portrayals of their ESG activities or outcomes. Our framework illustrates how green-
washing is re ected in multiple aspects of the report, beyond the simple biasing of reporting
low emissions when emissions were in fact high. We elaborate on various ways rms might
engage in greenwashing, and illustrate how parameters a¤ecting di¤erent types of green-
washing additionally a¤ect cash  ows, ESG e¤orts and outcomes, stock prices, and stock
price reactions to ESG reports. In particular, we examine ex-ante greenwashing related to
how the report is set up, as well as ex-post greenwashing driven by the manager s report-
ing and e¤ort choices. Ex-ante greenwashing in our model relates to how ESG e¤orts and
stochastic outcomes outside of the managerscontrol are aggregated. Aggregation policies
are important because di¤erent sensitivities to e¤orts or stochastic components can a¤ect
market responses and managersincentives (i.e., what ESG scores measure and how they are
aggregated matters). Ex-post greenwashing in our model comes from the manager s ability
to directly exaggerate (or dampen) reported ESG. Additionally, managers can increase ef-
forts that are captured relatively well in the ESG report, and at the same time reduce e¤orts
that have relatively small impacts on the report. Note that while reporting greenwashing
happens after the ESG e¤orts are chosen, it a¤ects the market response and therefore, in
equilibrium, can have an e¤ect on the manager s e¤ort choice. Through this channel, ESG
reporting features have real e¤ects on ESG activities and outcomes.
Our results provide guidance on how the characteristics of ESG reporting can a¤ect the
rm s ESG e¤orts and performance as well as the rm s cash  ows and stock price risk
premia. For example, when we focus on a single-e¤ort setting (to abstract away from issues
involving aggregation and e¤ort-report congruence) we show that many changes in report
characteristics a¤ect investorsprice response to the ESG report, the manager s e¤ort level,
and reporting greenwashing in the same direction. Capital market incentives encourage both
ESG-related e¤orts and greenwashing. Similarly, changes to investor and rm characteristics,
e.g., investorsaverage ESG concerns and ex-ante uncertainty about the manager s e¤orts,
3tend to move price responses, e¤orts, and greenwashing in the same direction. The multiple
paths for e¤ects on prices, reporting, and managerial e¤orts suggest caution in interpreting
empirical results (e.g., on inferring cash  ow e¤ects of ESG e¤orts from returns around ESG
reports or attributing heterogeneity in responses to ESG reports to the informativeness of
those reports without controlling for heterogeneity in investorsESG concerns).
Two particular characteristics of interest are the degree to which the report captures ESG
e¤orts/inputs versus performance/outcomes and the sensitivity of the report to di¤erent
types of e¤orts. Reporting ESG e¤orts rather than outcomes has a direct e¤ect of providing
stronger managerial motivation, since the report becomes more sensitive to controllable
e¤orts rather than uncontrollable outcomes. However, the e¤ort incentives are also driven
by the price responses to the report, which can be larger with outcome reporting. E¤ort
incentives are larger with outcome reporting if many investors are concerned about ESG
performance and a signicant portion of ESG performance is outside of the manager s control.
Focusing on how the report aggregates the manager s e¤orts, we investigate reports that
are congruent to cash  ows, to ESG, and to the average investor s values, while abstracting
away from reporting noise and uncontrollable ESG outcomes. Because investors use the
report to learn about the manager s e¤orts, a report that aggregates multiple e¤orts according
to their e¤ect on ESG does not perfectly reveal the cash- ow consequences of the manager s
e¤orts. This ESG-congruent report thus leaves investors with residual cash  ow uncertainty.
In contrast, a cash- ow congruent report reveals the e¤ects of e¤orts on cash  ows, which are
valued by all investors. This causes prices to react more strongly to the cash- ow congruent
report relative to the ESG-congruent report.2We show that, while a cash- ow-congruent
report leads to higher expected cash  ows, an ESG-congruent report leads to higher expected
ESG. Di¤erent regulators or standard-setters with di¤erent objective functions (e.g., cash
 ow versus ESG maximization) would thus naturally prefer reports with di¤erent sensitivities
2A necessary condition for the ESG-congruent report to have a higher price reaction is that the e¤orts
have a stronger e¤ect on ESG than on cash  ows. In this situation, cash- ow congruency perfectly reveals
cash  ow e¤ects that, in sum, are smaller than the imperfectly revealed ESG e¤ects.
4to managerial e¤orts. Interestingly, a values-congruent report (re ecting cash  ow impact
plus ESG impact weighted by the fraction of investors who value ESG) yields the same
expected cash  ows as the cash- ow-congruent report and the same expected ESG as the
ESG-congruent report. Unfortunately, the weights of the e¤orts in the values-congruent
report depend on the fraction of ESG investors, a parameter that likely varies over time and
across rms and is di¢ cult to measure for regulators, standard-setters, or rms interested in
designing ESG reports.
In an extension, we examine the addition of the ESG report to a setting with a noisy
nancial report already in place. The nancial report is congruent to cash  ows, but its noise
allows the ESG report to provide incremental information about the manager s e¤orts as well
as ESG outcomes outside of the manager s control. The general tenor of the equilibrium
is preserved, in that both reports a¤ect prices and managerial e¤orts, and greenwashing
persists. The addition of the ESG report increases the expected return around information
releases, which is due to the greater resolution of cash  ow uncertainty and thus larger
reduction in the risk premium at disclosures of the ESG and nancial reports relative to
the nancial report alone. Finally, the existence of a high-quality nancial report provides
su¢ cient cash- ow motivation to the manager such that an ESG-congruent ESG report leads
to the same cash  ows than a cash- ow-congruent ESG report. However, the ESG-congruent
report leads to a higher expected ESG performance. In other words, in the presence of high
quality nancial reporting, an ESG report does not distort cash  ow incentives.
2 Literature Review
We address regulatorsand researcherscall to improve our understanding of trade-o¤s related
to characteristics of managersreports about internal and external e¤ects of their ESG actions
(Christensen et al., 2019; Grewal and Serafeim, 2020). Our model broadly combines three
strands of literature. First, similar to the literature on multitask e¤ort allocation with
5moral hazard (e.g., Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1991; Datar et al., 2001), our model features a
manager who privately takes multiple actions that a¤ect the rm s outcomes. Second, as in
the literature on earnings management (e.g., Dye and Sridhar, 2004; Fischer and Verrecchia,
2000), our focal rm discloses a report that need not be truthful. Finally, some investors
who receive the report incorporate their beliefs about the rm s ESG when forming their
demand, similar to Pástor et al. (2020), Friedman and Heinle (2016), and additional studies
discussed in greater detail below.
We follow Paul (1992) and Feltham and Xie (1994) on their notion of the incongruity of
performance measures. We depart from these works in that we introduce an additional (non-
nancial) dimension of rm performance that is valued by some investors, which, in turn,
creates a second type of incongruity: between the social impact s and measure s sensitivities
to agent s actions.
Our model extends the literature on earnings management (e.g., Dye and Sridhar, 2008)
by allowing a manager to manipulate the report of rmsESG, i.e., to engage in greenwashing.
We analyze the manager s reporting strategy as a function of parameters capturing the
manager s incentives, information asymmetry between the manager and investors, and the
congruity of the report to the social and nancial impacts it may be designed to capture.
Several studies provide evidence that individuals value social impact of their investments.
For example, the survey in Krueger et al. (2020) suggests that institutional investors recog-
nize the importance of climate risks for their portfolioscash  ows. Similarly, Bauer et al.
(2021) survey members of pension funds and nd that two-thirds of respondents are willing
to sacrice some nancial benets to invest in companies whose goals are aligned with sus-
tainable development goals (SDG). Barber et al. (2021) and Bolton and Kacperczyk (2021)
provide further evidence of tradeo¤s between ESG and market performance.
The pricing of companiesnon-nancial performance has received much recent academic
interest. Closely related is Pástor et al. (2020), who show that agents tastes for green
holdings a¤ect asset prices in equilibrium and derive predictions about the returns on a
6green factor. Zerbib (2020) develops an asset-pricing model where ESG performance is
priced due to the impact of two investor groups: those that exclude certain assets from
their investment options and those that internalize private costs of externalities in their
expected returns. These investors cause two types of premia to occur: taste premia and
exclusion premia. Pedersen et al. (2020) analyze an economy where the ESG score contains
information related to rm fundamentals and some investors have preferences about rms
non-nancial performance. They show that in equilibrium, prices of assets satisfy a four-
fund separation theorem: each asset is a portfolio of a risk-free asset, a tangent portfolio, a
minimal-variance portfolio, and an ESG-tangent portfolio. Chowdhry et al. (2018), Oehmke
and Opp (2019), and Friedman and Heinle (2021) derive conditions for impact investment
to improve social outcomes when some investors value impact as well as cash  ows.
Most of the literature assumes symmetric information and/or is silent on the source of the
information that investors have about rmsnon-nancial performance. Lyon and Maxwell
(2011) provide a model of greenwashing based on discretionary disclosure of favorable signals
(e.g., Jung and Kwon, 1988), in contrast to our model of reporting bias with uncertain costs.
Despite the relative paucity of theoretical research, there exists rich empirical evidence for
rms greenwashing or providing inappropriate information on their ESG activities (e.g.,
Bingler et al., 2021; Basu et al., 2021; Delmas and Burbano, 2011; Marquis et al., 2016), as
well as numerous examples from the popular and business press (e.g., Brogger and Marsh,
2021; Kowsmann and Brown, 2021).
A separate literature has focused on the materiality of ESG disclosures (e.g., Khan et al.,
2016; Jebe, 2019). Amel-Zadeh and Serafeim (2018) report survey evidence that mainstream
investment organizations primarily use ESG information because of its relevance to invest-
ment performance, ahead of client demand and ethical considerations, though Moss et al.
(2020) nd no evidence of retail investors reacting to ESG press releases. Materiality im-
plies relevant to investor decision-making,and can be evaluated based either on relevance
to fundamentals, i.e., future cash  ows or discount rates, or based on investor responses
7to ESG information releases. The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) has
promulgated industry-specic sustainability standards that focus on materiality, while the
SEC encourages disclosure of material ESG information under existing disclosure rules. Our
model, by clearly delineating between cash  ow relevance, investor response, and e¤ects on
ESG allows us to show how focusing on di¤erent denitions of materiality in designing ESG
reports can a¤ect prices, greenwashing, and corporate ESG e¤orts.
A related debate to investor-focused materiality is on how trading activity and investor
engagement a¤ect rmssocial impact. Landier and Lovo (2020) show how the policy of an
ESG fund forces companies to internalize (at least partially) their externalities. An ESG
fund s optimal strategy is to invest in rms with the strongest capital search frictions and
most ine¢ cient externalities. Green and Roth (2021) derive optimal strategies for social
investors to maximize social welfare in an environment of competition between commercial
and social investors. De Angelis et al. (2020) show how companiesgreenhouse gas emissions
can be reduced through the increase in the cost of capital for those companies, wherein
the cost of capital becomes more sensitive to emissions as the share of green investors and
environmental stringency increase.
Our contribution to these streams of literature is through explicitly modeling rmsre-
porting of ESG activities as well as potential greenwashing. We show that in equilibrium, a
rm s price is sensitive to its ESG report, which is an aggregate signal of a manager s e¤ort
and a part of the rm s ESG performance that is out of the manager s control. We analyze
how price and its sensitivity to the report varies with report characteristics and show how
this sensitivity in turn a¤ects managersreal and reporting choices.
83 Model and equilibrium
The manager of a rm chooses two e¤orts, e= (e1;e2), each of which can a¤ect both the
rm s cash  ow and the rm s ESG output.3In particular, we assume that the rm has
per-share cash  ows of ~x= x Te+ ~""xand per-share ESG of ~y=Te+ ~""y, where ~""xand
~""yare independent, normally distributed random variables with means of 0and variances
of2
xand2
y, respectively, and where = (1;2)2<2and= (1;2)2<2are constant
vectors known by all actors. With i>0, e¤orteithat increases the expected ESG output
decreases cash  ows when i>0and increases cash  ows when i<0.
We assume that there is a continuum of investors with unit mass, and the supply of
shares is xed at 1. There is also a risk-free asset (money) with perfectly-elastic supply in
which investors can borrow or lend.4
All investors value cash  ows and are risk averse with respect to their cash holdings.
A-fraction of investors also value corporate ESG. We assume that the ESG-concerned
investors are risk-neutral with respect to ESG. Let qiandlidenote the amount of shares
and risk-free money held by investor i. Denote type-1 investors as those who care only
about cash  ows. Their utility is u1= exp [ (q1~x+l1)]. Type-2 investors, who also
value the rm s ESG performance (in risk-neutral expectation), have utility dened by
u2= exp [ (q2~x+l2) q2E[~yj
]] = exp [ (q2~x+l2)] exp [ q2E[~yj
]].
is the
information on which investors condition their expectations.
The rm s manager is interested in maximizing the rm s stock price and has a preference
over her e¤orts. In particular, we model the manager s preference for the ESG e¤orts with
the costP

the manager s preferences, but i, the manager s expected bliss action on e¤ort ei, and

e¤ort allocation. The analysis extends straightforwardly to higher-dimension e¤ort vectors.

in our subsequent discussion of the e¤ects of the ESG report.

As Proposition 1 shows, the manager chooses e¤orts equal to her bliss points, ei=i,8i.
As a result, the expected e¤orts are given by their expected bliss points, i. Because investors
receive no additional information, the rm s price is given by expected cash  ows, E[x] =

plus the preference-weighted expected ESG output, E[y] =T. These results follow
prior literature where ESG output is random and a -fraction of investors has a risk-neutral
warm glow from holding shares in a rm that provides this ESG output (e.g., Chowdhry
et al., 2018; Pástor et al., 2020; Pedersen et al., 2020).
Note that we allow for a correlation in cash  ows and ESG: an incremental unit of e¤ort
eiincreases ESG output by iand decreases cash  ows by i. As a result, when all investors
know that the manager has taken an additional unit of e¤ort ei, price changes by i i. In
addition, because investors are risk averse with respect to cash  ows, the uncertainty about
the e¤ort e¤ect on cash  ows increases the risk premium. That is, the risk premium arises
in response to both the fundamental risk in cash  ows, 2
x, as well as the variation in cash
 ows that arises from the manager s e¤ort choice, T.
103.1 ESG reporting
In the no-report setting above, investors receive no information about the manager s e¤ort or
the other random components in cash  ows or ESG performance. In what follows, we extend
the model to include a rm s report about its aggregate ESG performance. In particular,
After observing and choosing e, the manager releases a report about the rm s ESG
performance, y.
To analyze the e¤ect of di¤erent reporting regimes and choices, we allow e¤orts and
""yto have di¤erential e¤ects on the ESG report. Furthermore, to incorporate ESG-report
biasing, an important facet of greenwashing, we assume that the report, r, need not be
the manager s truthful expectation of ybut can be biased. Specically, we assume that
the manager s cost of providing report riscr

r). As in
Dye and Sridhar (2004, p. 56), ""rre ects idiosyncratic circumstances that in uence the
[manager s] misreporting costsand prevents unraveling of the reporting bias e¤ect in pricing,
and could alternatively be incorporated via a mechanism as in Fischer and Verrecchia (2000)
with uncertain incentives. The non-random reporting cost term, cr, is a positive constant.
The= (1;2)Tterm captures sensitivities of the report (and therefore reporting costs)
to e¤orts, while captures the sensitivity of the report to the uncontrolled component of
ESG,""y. For example, when ""r= 0, the manager can avoid any reporting costs by choosing
r=Te+""y. As such we can interpret (;)as the weights on di¤erent elements dened in
ESG reporting regulation or in a rm s ESG reporting policies. These reporting parameters
allow us to capture whether the report re ects ESG inputs (i.e., e¤orts) or ESG outcomes
(i.e., e¤orts and the uncontrollable ""y) as well as two types of reporting incongruity. The
rst, which we might call cash  ow incongruity, is the degree to which1

ESG report fails to proportionately capture the relative impacts of e1ande2on expected

Proposition 2 summarizes the equilibrium in the game with an ESG disclosure and com-
pares the price to the setting without an ESG disclosure. The equilibrium price in (5) and
the price di¤erence in (6) show that the disclosure of the ESG report to the market has
three e¤ects on the price of the rm. First, there is a real e¤ect through the manager s
e¤ort incentives. This e¤ect is given by the rst term in (6), 

vestors are risk averse with respect to cash  ows only, so the reduction in the risk premium
13comes from learning about the manager s e¤orts and their e¤ects on cash  ows, rather than
from the ESG performance beyond the manager s control, ""y.6
3.3 Greenwashing
A fourth implication of Proposition 2 is that when investors receive and respond to an ESG
report, the manager has incentives to alter the report in order to change investorspercep-
tions about the rm. We refer to this behavior as greenwashing. Prior literature has provided
multiple denitions for greenwashing. Delmas and Burbano (2011, p. 65) dene greenwash-
ing as the intersection of two rm behaviors: poor environmental performance and positive
communication about environmental performance. Implicit in their denition is a diver-
gence between performance and communication. Lyon and Maxwell (2011, p. 9) capture
greenwashing in a selective disclosure model, and dene greenwashing as selective disclosure
of positive information about a company s environmental or social performance, without full
disclosure of negative information on these dimensions, so as to create an overly positive
corporate image.In our model, selective disclosure could be related to the properties of the
report (;)when some actions or some random outcomes are not measured. However, our
model does not have a discretionary component per se where the rm or manager observe
performance before deciding whether to disclose it. It is reasonably straightforward to inter-
pret variation in ,, or""ras outcomes of an unmodeled partial disclosure subgame insofar
as they reduce market participantsability to infer yfromr.
Following Delmas and Burbano (2011), total greenwashing in our setting is the di¤erence
between the report, r, and the ESG performance, y:
G=r y= 
cr+Te+""y+""r
 Te ""y
= ( )Te+ ( 1)""y+ 
cr+""r. (7)
6See Friedman and Heinle (2016) for a setting where investors are also risk averse with respect to ESG
performance. This creates a second risk-premium term, similar to that for cash- ow risk but multiplied by
.
14The total greenwashing in (7) can be decomposed into ex-ante components (associated with
the design of the report) and ex-post components (associated with equilibrium e¤orts and
reporting bias). There are two ex-ante components. The rst is the degree to which the
sensitivity of the report to e¤orts di¤ers from the sensitivity of ESG to e¤orts, which re ects
ESG incongruence. This is captured by ( )Tmultiplying ein the rst term. The
second is the degree to which the report captures variation in ESG performance outside the
manager s control, ""y. This is re ected in the ( 1)term multiplying ""y. In our model,
the term ( 1)allows us to vary whether the report captures e¤orts/inputs (i.e., e¤orts
such as amounts spent on carbon mitigation, = 0) or performance/outcomes (i.e., actual
emissions as re ected in y,= 1).
There are also two ex-post components of greenwashing in (7). These two are related to
the manager s equilibrium choices regarding reporting and e¤orts. First, reporting green-
washing, captured by 
cr+""r, captures greenwashing driven by the manager s reporting
choice,r. Reporting greenwashing depends on the price responsiveness to the report,  , the
non-random cost of reporting bias, cr, and the idiosyncratic component of the manager s
reporting objective, ""r. In the Dye and Sridhar (2004) framework, which we adopt, the
random reporting incentives ""rbecome similar to measurement noise from the perspective of
investors. In equilibrium, the manager places a weight of 1on the random term and simply
adds it to the report. The expected reporting greenwashing is given by 
cr, which depends
on andcr, but is unwound by investors in equilibrium.
Second, real greenwashing is based on the manager s e¤orts, e. In addition to the bliss
point,, the manager also considers the marginal impact of e¤ort on price through the
disclosed report. In particular, the 
ceterm in (3) incorporates how price changes with
the report,  , the sensitivity of the report to e¤orts, , and e¤ort costs, ce. These jointly
determine the manager s deviation from the privately observed bliss e¤orts, . For instance,
when the report increases in e1but decreases in e2, i.e.,1>0>2, and stock price increases
in the report, i.e.,  > 0, the manager will choose higher e1and lowere2relative to the
15equilibrium without reporting. This real greenwashing arises because the manager increases
ESG e¤orts that are measured in disclosed reports. As an example, consider a report that
captures a rm s carbon emissions but omits information about the production and release
of hazardous chemicals such as PFAS (poly uoroalkyl substances). In this situation, real
greenwashing occurs when the manager shifts her e¤orts towards the reduction of carbon
emissions and away from avoiding hazardous chemical releases.
4 Analysis
In this section, we further analyze the four e¤ects that ESG disclosure has on prices. In our
model, there are two sets of parameters that a¤ect the equilibrium outcomes. The rst set
of parameters relates to the signal-to-noise ratio in the ESG report: the amount of variation
in the report that is due to the manager s e¤ort, jj; the variance of the reporting noise,
2
r; the variance of the exogenous ESG variation, 2
y; and whether exogenous ESG variation
is measured in the report at all, . The second set of parameters relates to the degree to
which the report captures each e¤ort, 1and2, which determine the congruence of the
report with cash  ows and ESG output. Because each comparative static is a¤ected by all
the other parameters, we conduct our analysis in two steps. First, we isolate the e¤ects of
the parameters that a¤ect the signal-to-noise ratio in a setting with a single e¤ort. Then we
isolate the e¤ects of congruency in a setting with two e¤orts but without noise in the report.
In both settings, we investigate the price response to the disclosure of the ESG report, the
real e¤ect of the ESG report, the e¤ect of disclosure on the expected returns, and the e¤ect
on greenwashing.
4.1 Single-e¤ort setting
This section limits the manager s choice set to a single e¤ort, e=e, which allows for scalar
representations that focus on the implications of investor preferences, e¤ort costs, and ESG-
16related sources of uncertainty. To examine the equilibrium, we substitute =,=,
=,=2

Corollary 1 When ESG e¤orts are one-dimensional, and ;; I>0, the price response

of ESG to managerial e¤ort ( ), and the sensitivity of cash  ows to managerial e¤ort (  ).

Corollary 1 shows that when the manager s e¤ort is more important to investors (higher
values of,, and ) the price response to the report is higher. Similarly, more noise in the
report induced by reporting bias, ""r, reduces the response coe¢ cient. These results follow
from the e¤ect of the respective parameters on the signal-to-noise ratio. The e¤ects of the
other parameters are more subtle.
First, while ESG interested investors learn about the uncontrollable ESG performance
from the report, this random performance is noise from the perspective of an investor who
is interested only in cash  ows. Which of these two forces (i.e., learning/signal versus noise)
dominates depends on parameter values and determines the e¤ects of the amount of uncon-
trollable ESG performance risk, 2
y, and the weight of that risk in the report, . For example,
when= 0then the price impact decreases in both 2
yandbecause no investor is interested
in""yand, thus, all investors treat it as a noise term. When =, the manager s e¤ort
17does not a¤ect the performance that the average investor cares about. In this situation, an
increase in 2
yor(for low) increases the price impact because the ESG investor still tries
to infer""yfrom the report.
The report s sensitivity to the managerial e¤ort and the e¤ort uncertainty, and2
,
are similar to the reporting weight, , and the variance of the uncontrollable ESG risk, 2
y.
Investors, in aggregate, use the report to learn about the manager s e¤ort, which is unknown
ex-ante due to uncertainty about her bliss action, , as well as the uncontrollable portion
of the ESG outcome, ""y. An increase in the sensitivity of the report to the manager s e¤ort
makes the report more re ective of e¤ort but less re ective of ""y. If the ESG and cash  ow
e¤ects of e¤ort o¤set, i.e., ( )0, then the condition in (10) will tend to be negative
precisely because higher makes the report less informative about ""y, which is valued by
theportion of type-2 investors. When the e¤ect of e¤ort on values-weighted outcomes is
large, i.e., ( )>>0, then learning about e¤ort is important. However,d I
dcan still be
negative, particularly if 2
2is large relative to 22
y+2
r. This latter e¤ect occurs because
the variance of ris quadratic in (with coe¢ cient 2
), while the use of rto learn about
e¤ort is driven by the covariance between e¤orts and expected outcomes ( E[x]andE[y]),
which is linear in .
The following corollary investigates the real e¤ect of changes in the exogenous parameters
on managerial e¤ort.
Corollary 2 The e¤ects in Corollary 1 that increase  Ialso increase the manager s expected
e¤ort (E[e
I]) with the exception of an increase in . An increase in increases the manager s
expected e¤ort when

Generally speaking, the e¤ect of the manager s e¤ort on price depends on the price
response coe¢ cient  I. When a shift in an exogenous parameter increases the price response,
the manager has stronger incentives to provide e¤ort and thus provides more. However, this
intuition can be violated when the manager s impact on the report, , increases. An increase
18in, assuming  I>0, directly increases e¤ort incentives because the report increases more
for every unit of e¤ort. However, as shown in Corollary 1, an increase in can cause a
decrease in  I. This e¤ect can dominate the direct e¤ect of an increase in such that a
stronger reporting sensitivity to the manager s e¤ort can lead to a lower e¤ort provision.
As the expression in (12) shows, when the report measures ESG inputs rather than outputs
(= 0) an increase in always increases the price response coe¢ cient and, thus, leads
to an increase in the manager s e¤ort. However, when the report measures outputs and
when investorsare su¢ ciently interested in the random ESG variation (i.e., 2
y>>0),
then increasing the impact of the manager s e¤ort in the report reduces the price response
coe¢ cient I, and can reduce the manager s e¤ort.
Our further analysis in this subsection relates to the expected return around the disclosure
of an ESG report. Because investors have rational expectations, the expected report only
a¤ects price through the risk premium. Because investors learn about the manager s choices,
they face less uncertainty about cash  ows and, thus, demand a lower risk premium. In
particular, the disclosure reduces the risk premium by 224

22
+22y+2r, which is the single-
e¤ort equivalent of the last term in (6). The following corollary analyzes the expected return
around the ESG disclosure.
Corollary 3 When ESG e¤orts are one-dimensional and ;; I>0, the expected return
around the ESG disclosure is increasing in ,, and2
and is decreasing in ,2
y, and2
r.
Corollary 3 highlights the con ict in learning about cash  ows and ESG performance.
Because investors in our model are risk neutral with respect to ESG performance, the ex-
pected return increases when investors learn more about cash  ows. In particular, a higher
reporting sensitivity to the e¤ort, a higher productivity of the e¤ort, and more ex-ante un-
certainty about the e¤ort increase the expected return. Variation in the report that is due
to factors that do not a¤ect cash  ows, on the other hand, reduces the expected return.
Finally, we investigate the impact of parameter changes on equilibrium greenwashing.
In the single-e¤ort setting the expected total greenwashing (based on the denition in 7) is
19given by
E[G
I] =E[r
I y
I] = ( )E[e
I] + I
cr(13)
The rst term, ( )E[e
I], measures the amount of expected real greenwashing. In the
single-e¤ort setting, the manager cannot shift e¤orts towards measured components. In
other words, there is no real greenwashing driven by cross-e¤ort allocation. However, the
ESG report can present the rm as overly green when  > . The second term re ects the
manager s reporting bias, I
cr, in expectation. Because the price impact of the ESG report
is independent of the reporting cost, all comparative statics from Corollary 1 that increase
 also increase the expected reporting-related greenwashing in (13). This greenwashing,
however, is anticipated by investors in equilibrium and unwound from the report.
4.2 Two-e¤ort setting
In this section, we go back to the baseline model in which the manager takes two actions.
However, to eliminate the e¤ect of noise in the report (from the perspective of the investors),
we assume that 2
y=2
r= 0. In particular, when 2
r= 0, there is no uncertainty about the
manager s bias. This allows investors to unravel the manager s reporting strategy to infer
the linear combination of e¤orts implied by Te. Furthermore, when 2
y= 0, ESG outcomes
are determined entirely by the manager s e¤orts. Consequently, the report only captures
variation in ESG that is associated, via managerial e¤orts, with cash  ows (for i6= 0). As
a result, the parameter has no impact on the equilibrium. In sum, we set 2
y=2
r= 0to
focus on the e¤ect of congruence in the reporting system.
Below, we examine three potential types of reports: cash- ow congruent ( = ), ESG
congruent (=), and values congruent ( = ). We view these as relevant from the
perspective of various standard setters, regulators, rms, and investors. Our approach focuses
on intuitive types of congruence rather than optimal congruence derived conditional on a
particular objective function, mainly because di¤erent parties will have di¤erent objectives
20regarding ESG reporting. Nonetheless, comparisons across report types that di¤er in is
informative with regard to tradeo¤s across outcomes that heterogeneous parties will evaluate
di¤erently (e.g., cash  ows versus ESG performance versus what is valued by a representative
investor). To avoid trivial situations in which the three types of reports are equivalent, we
assume throughout that cash- ow and ESG impacts are not perfectly aligned, i.e., there is
no constant such that=.

The last term in equation (16) is the risk premium based only on 2
x. The risk premium
term shows that when there is no measurement noise and the report aggregates the e¤orts in
the same way that they a¤ect cash  ows, investors can perfectly infer any variation in cash
 ows that stems from the manager s e¤orts. However, equation (15) suggests that investors
cannot perfectly infer the impact of the manager s e¤orts on the ESG output. In particular,
the market response coe¢ cient in (15) is equal to 1, for the cash- ow relevant news, minus
a term,T
T, that shows that ESG interested investors are not able to infer all ESG
variation because the e¤orts are not aggregated for that purpose. The numerator in this
term captures incongruence between ESG and cash  ow implications via T, weighted
by thecovariance matrix.

in
(18) is equal to (capturing the fraction of investors who value the ESG relevant information

e¤ects from the ESG-congruent report. As above, this term captures incongruence between
ESG and cash  ow implications, weighted by the covariance matrix, via T.

allows us to discuss di¤erences in expected e¤orts and bias.

.
In Corollary 4, part (i) shows that because all investors care about cash  ows, the market
response to a report that focuses on cash- ow implications tends to be higher. The market
response to a report that focuses on ESG outputs is higher if the e¤orts that show up in the
report have a stronger impact on the ESG outputs. That is, in a scenario without reporting
noise, the response coe¢ cient is largely dictated by three components: how much there is
to learn about each e¤ort ( 2
); how congruent the report is to the interest of the respective
investor; and how important the respective task is. In turn, this implies that when the
vectorsandare of equal length ( jj=jj), then2
y=2
r= 0and=2
Iimply that
the market response is stronger to a cash- ow oriented ESG report.
Part (ii) of Corollary 4 e¤ectively echoes the adage you get what you measure. In
particular, when the response coe¢ cient is positive, the manager has incentives to provide a
higher aggregate report. This implies that when the report is congruent to the rm s ESG
output, then the manager has incentives to allocate more e¤ort to a task that has a higher
impact on the ESG output. ESG output is the same in both reporting systems when = 0.
That is, when ESG is priced only for its e¤ects on cash  ows, di¤erent reporting systems do
not yield di¤erent expected ESG outcomes. Furthermore, ESG and cash  ow converge under
both reporting systems as1
2!1
2, that is, when the relative sensitivities of cash  ows and
ESG to the manager s e¤orts converge or, alternatively, when andbecome congruent
such that!for a scalar .
Finally, part (iii) shows that the rm s expected stock price is higher under an ESG-
congruent reporting system when the fraction of investors that value ESG is su¢ ciently
large. Corollary 4 part (iii) also shows that the threshold for increases in the risk aversion
and the variance of the e¤ort incentives. As we discuss above, investors in our model are
risk averse with respect to cash  ows, but risk neutral with respect to ESG. For this reason,
the risk premium embedded in price is lower when the report is cash- ow congruent, as
investors can use the cash- ow congruent report to infer the e¤ort-induced variation in cash
23 ows. A lower investor risk aversion (or e¤ort uncertainty), lowers the price benet of a
cash- ow congruent report. Furthermore, part (iii) shows that the threshold for increases
in the length of the vector but decreases in the length of the vector . When cash  ow
is relatively more sensitive to the e¤orts measured in the ESG report (i.e., a high value
for2
1+2
2=T=jj2), a cash- ow congruent report has a more benecial e¤ect on cash
 ows, which makes it more likely that a cash- ow congruent reporting system leads to higher
expected prices.
When considering ESG reporting options, Corollary 4 (ii) implies that when the goal is
to motivate stronger ESG performance, the report should focus directly on the ESG outcome
and should dene materiality (i.e., what should be included in the report) in terms of the
ESG outcome, rather than in terms of the rm s cash  ows. Put another way, ex ante ESG
congruence discourages ex post real greenwashing. However, disclosure standards that are ex
ante ESG congruent will come at a cost to cash  ows. From part (iii) of Corollary 4, managers
who seek to maximize expected stock price may nevertheless advocate for ESG-congruent
reporting standards when there are enough ESG sensitive investors in the market.
The analysis of the expected ESG performance, y, also relates to real greenwashing to
the extent that the manager shifts e¤orts towards measured activities. When the report is
ESG congruent, shifting e¤ort towards measured activities is benecial to the rm s ESG
performance, which leads to the above results. Expected greenwashing, from (7), also re ects
reporting bias for both cash  ow- an ESG-congruent reports, which are
E[G
] = (+)TE[e
] + 
crandE
G

= 
cr, (20)
respectively. The expressions in (20) show that the e¤ects on  in Corollary 4 (i) carry over
to the comparison of the reporting bias for the two reporting systems, assuming that crare
the same. However, total expected greenwashing also di¤ers between the two reporting sys-
tems due to the real greenwashing that occurs in the cash  ow-congruent system while being
24absent from the ESG-congruent system. ESG-congruent reporting eliminates the misrep-
resentation of the manager s impact on the rm s ESG performance. Thus, total expected
greenwashing can be higher under cash  ow-congruent reporting than ESG-congruent re-
porting even when prices are more responsive to ESG-congruent reports (i.e., when  > 
and (+)TE[e
]>   
cr). Conversely, total expected greenwashing can be lower un-
der cash  ow-congruent reporting than ESG-congruent reporting even when prices are more
responsive to cash  ow congruent reports (i.e., when  > and(+)TE[e
]>   
cr).
Price responses alone, therefore, are not su¢ cient statistics for total greenwashing, despite
their ability to inform about reporting-related greenwashing.
4.2.2 Values congruence
The discussion so far shows that congruence of the report to the rm s ESG output and to
cash  ows come with di¤erent costs. However, both of these reporting systems are incon-
gruent to the interests of an average, representative investor who values e¤orts according to
 . In this section, we investigate a values-congruent reporting system ( = ),
maintaining our assumptions of 2
y=2
r= 0and=2
I, to focus on congruity and
e¤ort-sensitivity issues. Here, the equilibrium is given by

Because the report is not congruent with cash  ows (for >0and126=21), the report
does not eliminate investorsuncertainty about the e¤ects of e¤ort on cash  ows, leaving a
higher risk premium in (23) than with cash- ow congruent reporting in (16). However, a
25values congruent report leads to an even higher risk premium than an ESG-congruent report
when 2>2
1+2
2
11+22. Notice that when one e¤ort increases cash  ows ( i<0) and the other
e¤ort decreases cash  ows (  i>0), while both e¤orts increase ESG output ( 1;2>0) the
values congruent report will receive most of its variation from the e¤ort that increases cash
 ows. As a result, investors will not be able to learn about the e¤ort that decreases cash
 ows and may, thus, end up with a higher posterior uncertainty.
The following corollary compares outcomes for the values-congruent reporting system

Corollary 5 (i) shows the strong result that ESG output and cash  ows are at least as
high with the values congruent report than with either of the other two reports. Parts
(ii) and (iii) illustrate tradeo¤s related to the reportse¤ects on the risk premium versus
their real e¤ects on e¤orts. In particular, when the risk aversion and the e¤ort uncertainty
are su¢ ciently large (such that the conditions in the corollary are violated) and when the
condition 2>2

Clearly, values-congruent reports, while encouraging higher levels of expected ESG perfor-
mance and cash  ows, do not eliminate expected greenwashing. Presence of real green-
washing may increase expected greenwashing in a values-congruent report compared to an
26ESG-congruent report. However, if price response to the ESG-congruent report is small
enough
 (+ (1 ))TE[e]>  1

, a report aligned with ESG outcomes can lead to
more greenwashing. Whether the values-congruent report increases greenwashing respec-
tive to the cash- ow-congruent report depends on the real greenwashing for both reports
(E[e];E[e
]), the importance of real greenwashing to investors, and the magnitude of price
response to a cash- ow-congruent report ().
5 Financial report
In the main model, the ESG report is the only source of information to investors.7However,
investors also have access to nancial reports that convey earnings and cash  ow information.
To investigate the interaction between nancial and ESG reports, we extend the main model
by introducing an additional nancial report: ~f= ~x+ ~""f, with ~""fN(0;2
f). We assume
it is disclosed simultaneously with the ESG report, r, and, in contrast to the ESG report, is
not subject to managerial discretion.
Similar to the benchmark in the main model, we rst analyze a setting where the ESG
report is not disclosed. Proposition 3 derives the manager s e¤ort and the equilibrium price
when only the nancial report is disclosed.
Proposition 3 In the equilibrium with disclosure of only the nancial report, the optimal
e¤ort and the stock market price are given by

T+2x+2
f.
Similar to Proposition 2, where the rm only discloses an ESG report, the manager s
e¤ort choices are driven by the manager s preferences, , and the sensitivity of price to
the manager s e¤orts relative to their cost,   f0
ce. The coe¢ cient  f0measures the impact
of the nancial report on price, and the coe¢ cient  is the sensitivity of the nancial
report to the manager s actions. The risk premium in equation (28) shows that because
the nancial report is perfectly congruent with cash  ows, only the measurement noise, 2
f,
prevents investors from perfectly learning the rm s cash  ows.
When the rm discloses both a nancial report and an ESG report, the manager chooses
her e¤ort knowing that both reports in uence the rm s price. Thus, the sensitivities of
both reports to managerial e¤orts a¤ect equilibrium e¤orts, and through e¤orts, cash  ows
and ESG performance. In the proof to Proposition 4 we derive the full equilibrium for the
setting with nancial and ESG reporting. Relative to Proposition 3, the addition of the ESG
report a¤ects the manager s e¤ort, greenwashing, and how investors use both reports.
Proposition 4 The expected return at the disclosure of the ESG and the nancial report in
tandem is higher than at the disclosure of the nancial report only.
Because the two reports both aggregate the manager s e¤orts, they are correlated with
each other and investors use both reports to inform their trading strategies. In the knife-edge
case of a nancial report without noise ( 2
f!0), cash- ow oriented investors put a weight
of1on the nancial report and do not use the ESG report at all. However, ESG-oriented
investors continue to use both reports to (potentially) learn about random ESG variation.
Notably, the result that the risk premium of a rm that discloses both reports is lower
than the risk premium of a rm that only discloses a nancial report holds only when there
is noise in the nancial report. In particular, the di¤erence in risk premia is given by

28This term shows that investors demand a higher risk premium in the absence of the ESG
report but that the di¤erence goes away as 2
f!0.
Adding an ESG report to a nancial report in the single-e¤ort setting of Section 4.1 is
tantamount to decreasing the prior uncertainty about all random variables (except for the
ESG related noise terms, ""yand""r). However, how the relative sensitivities of the ESG
report a¤ect the equilibrium is a function of the nancial report. In deriving the following
corollary, we return to the setting of Section 4.2 and set 2
y=2
r= 0and=2
I. For
further simplicity, we set 2
f= 0such that the nancial report is noiseless. The following
corollary analyzes the impact of the congruence of the ESG report to either cash  ows or
ESG on the rm s expected cash  ows and ESG.
Corollary 6 When2
y=2
r=2
f= 0and=2
I, expected cash  ow, E[x], is the same
under cash- ow-congruent and ESG-congruent reports; expected ESG, E[y], is weakly higher
with an ESG-congruent report.
Corollary 6 shows that when a high-quality (i.e., 2
f= 0) nancial report is available, the
rm s expected cash  ows do not su¤er for an ESG-congruent ESG report. In essence, the
high-quality nancial report provides su¢ cient incentives to increase cash  ows. However,
the proposition also shows that the rm s expected ESG performance can su¤er when the rm
provides an ESG report that is cash- ow-congruent report rather than ESG-congruent. This
shows a potential downside of focusing on cash  ow implications of ESG related activities,
conditional on the prior existence of high-quality nancial reporting.
6 Conclusion
ESG reporting is of interest to investors for multiple reasons: some investors inherently care
about the rm s ESG, and all investors plausibly care about the potential cash- ow conse-
quences of the rm s ESG e¤orts. These reasons cause investors to incorporate information
gleaned from ESG reports into their trading decisions, which in turn provides a channel, via
29stock price, that motivates rms and managers to shift their real e¤orts. Additionally, price
motives can push managers to engage in activities that a¤ect only the report (e.g., green-
washing via reporting bias). Our model characterizes the frictions central to the setting of
ESG reporting to investors and develops predictions for how features of the ESG report as
well as characteristics of rms and investors a¤ect ESG reports, market pricing, corporate
actions, and greenwashing.
In particular, we develop implications related to whether the report re ects the rm s
ESG performance, the rm s ESG e¤orts, or the impacts of ESG actions on cash  ows.
Reporting that better captures cash- ow (ESG) e¤ects tilts corporate actions towards in-
creasing cash  ows (ESG). Reports that are congruent with investorsvalues, on average,
motivate managers to improve expected cash  ows and ESG. Additionally, several features
discussed above a¤ect market responses to disclosure of ESG reports. When market price
responses are stronger, managers tend to have greater incentives to increase the report, ei-
ther through real ESG-related e¤orts or through report biasing. Broadly, greenwashing is a
natural outcome of investor concern over rmsESG performance. While it is not desirable
in and of itself, increased greenwashing may be viewed as a side e¤ect of an increase in
societal concerns over corporate ESG performance.
Because our model features e¤ects on both cash  ows and ESG, the predictions from our
model could help guide future analyses that incorporate data on nancial, ESG, and market
performance. We show that reporting standards that lead to lower cash  ows need not lead
to lower stock prices when investors directly value ESG, and that divergence between cash
 ow e¤ects and market performance may re ect investorsESG preferences. As a result,
regulators, standard setters, and researchers should consider more than stock price reactions
or future cash  ows independently when evaluating the materiality of ESG reports, partic-
ularly when materiality is interpreted as a¤ecting investor decisions rather than through a
lens focused on nancial performance per se. Furthermore, the optimal ESG report proper-
ties will depend, naturally, on the objective function being maximized. Firms or investors
30seeking to maximize cash  ows should prefer di¤erent reports relative to regulators inter-
ested in maximizing ESG performance or standard setters looking to maximize the amount
of information available to dispersed investors.
Stepping back, we view our framework as a stepping stone (rather than a rst step) on
the long and intertwined paths of research related to ESG reporting. Prior studies have
generated useful foundations, but there is much additional work to be done, and our frame-
work provides some guideposts. For instance, little is known as to how preferences over
ESG performance are formed and change over time, or whether investors are risk averse,
risk neutral, or risk seeking with regards to corporate ESG. While our model focuses on a
one-epoch single-rm setting, additional frictions and forces plausibly arise with multiple
periods and rms. Additional dimensions of investor heterogeneity, including information
asymmetry and di¤erences in wealth or risk aversion are also likely to lead to additional
interesting results. In modeling the rm, we have also focused on a manager who seeks
to maximize price. Contracting on ESG related performance measures opens up additional
avenues for ESG reports to be relevant to rm performance and risk. While we have focused
on a single ESG report, potentially in the presence of extant nancial reports, the landscape
is characterized by a broad and shifting set of ESG information providers. Our results re-
lated to investor learning suggest that multiple ESG reports capturing di¤erent dimensions
may be benecial to investors, rather than just re ecting disagreement between vendors or
rent seeking. Stepping back, we view ESG reporting as a fertile eld likely to sprout many
interesting studies relevant to researchers, regulators, and practitioners.

Proof of Proposition 2
Below, we derive a linear equilibrium in which
1. The risky asset s price is a linear function of the report: p=a+br;
2. The manager s choice of e¤ort eiis linear in, i.e.,e=e+e, wheree= (e1;e2)T
ande=0

y""y+r""r, wherer= (r1;r2)T.
Proceeding via backward induction, we start with the competitive market for rm shares
in period 2, conditional on the report, r, provided to the market. All investors observe r.
Firm nancial and ESG outputs are:
~x= x Te+ ~""xand
~y=Te+ ~""y

e=e+e, investor demands are given by

Market clearing implies q2+ (1 )q1= 1and solving for pgives
p=x+y x,
32such that price is a linear function of the report, r.
Next, we derive the manager s reporting strategy conditional on the market pricing func-

RE: The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors 
(Release Nos. 33-11042 ; 34-94478 ; File No. S7-10-22 ) 
Dear Ms. Countryman : 
The Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association (LACERA) appreciates the 
opportunity to submit comments in response to the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC 
or Commission) proposed rules regarding the enhancement and standardization of climate­
related disclosures for investors, published in the Federal Register on April 11, 2022 (Proposed 
Rules).1 
LACERA is the largest county pension system in the United States, with approximate ly 
$73 billion in plan assets as of May 30, 2022, including equity holdings in about 2,400 U.S. 
companies. LACERA's mission is ""to produce, protect, and provide the promised benefits"" for 
over 170,000 beneficiar ies who serve the most populous county in the nation. We encourage 
public policies governing financial markets that strengthen our position to fulfill our fiduciary duties 
and serve our mission. 
We welcome the Commission's Proposed Rules to require publicly-listed companies to 
disclose climate-related risks that may have a material impact on their financial performance and 
greenhouse gas emissions to enable investors to assess exposures to such risks. Our comments 
to the Commission are guided by the investment beliefs and principles outlined in LACERA's 
Investment Policy Statement2 and Corporate Governance and Stewardship Principles3 and 
further our letter to the Commission dated June 10, 2021, responding to the Commission's 
request for information related to climate risk disclosure practices and uses (June 2021 Letter).4 
As articulated in our guiding investment policies, LAC ERA recognizes that climate change 
presents financial risks and opportunities for both individual portfolio companies in our portfolio 
as well as to the broader economy in which we invest. 5 We consider that financial markets work 
most efficiently when investors have timely, reliable, and comparab le information about material 
aspects of a firm's performance, including how they manage material risks such as climate-related

factors that may impact  firm value and free cash flow. Transparency of a firm’s key financial and 
operating performance is critical for investors to assess a firm’s financial viability and prospects 
for creating and sustaining  financial  value. As a diversified, global investor with exposures in over 
65 global markets , it is i ntegral to our ability to fulfill our fiduciary duty to identify, diversify, and 
mitigate known investment risks  in our portfolio. To the extent  that a risk is not expected to be 
rewarded in the long-term or mitigated through diversification, LACERA endeavors to minimize it.   
 Accordingly, we welcome the P roposed Rules to enhance the consistency, comparability, 
and reliability of market disclosures relat ed to climate risks.  As stated in our June 2021 Letter:
6 
 
Reliable disclosures on all material performance and risk indicators are critical to 
LACERA’s investment process. We rely on companies to assess and disclose material 
risks so that they may pursue suitable, resilient business strategies and so that we as 
investors may adequately price risks and inform investment decisions. In recent years, we 
have incorporated climate and ESG data – to the extent it is available and reliable – into 
strategic asset allocation models, total fund portfolio analytics, and asset manager 
selection and monitoring, to highlight financial risks and opportunities and pursue 
deliberate strategies in line with our investment objectives. 
 
Our comments to the Commission’s Proposed Rules are framed into five parts:  
 
1. Alignment and Harmonization with Recognized Global Reporting Frameworks  
 LACERA is a global investor with investments spanning more than 65 global markets and 
over 8,000 companies, in line with our fiduciary duty to diversify risks. Our portfolio holdings have 
global reach and supply chains. We have endorsed the Task force on Climate -related Financial 
Disclosures  (TCFD) ,
7 have been members of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board 
Investor Advisory Group and are members of the newly formed International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) Investor Advisory Group,
8 and are a signatory to the Investor Statement 
to Global Governments on Climate Change,9 all of which support cohesive measures to facilitate 
consistent, reliable, and comparable corporate disclosures of financially relevant, climate -related 
risks regardless of market or jurisdiction.  
 We welcome the Proposed Rules’ reference and incorporation of the TCFD reporting 
framework , which we view as a globally recognized framework to enhance financially -material , 
decision- useful  climate risks as informed by market participants , inclus ive of firms ’ governance 
oversight  of climate risks , key metrics, and relevance to business strategy . As referenced in our 
June 2021 Letter, t he Proposed Rules’ leveraging of globally recognized, market- informed 
frameworks  further global harmonization of reporting guidance and support consistency, 
comparability, and reliability of needed climate disclosures. Alignment with the TCFD, as 
proposed, would also enable cost -effectiveness for firms and investors alike, by minimizing the 
need for firms to navigate distinct and possibly  divergent reporting demands in different markets 
in which they operate.  We encourage the proposed incorporation of the TCFD framework in any 
final Commission rules .

2. Clear  Disclosure of Baseline Data Points Across the Value Chain  
 
We also welcome the Proposed Rules’ aim to facilitate reporting of greenhouse gas 
emissions across the full scope of the value chain, inclusive of Scope 3 emissions. As we noted 
in our June 2021 Letter, “Emissions are a critical baseline data point for further investment 
analysis, such as stress testing and scenario analyses of forward -looking investment risks, 
including prospective impacts related to a transition to a low -carbon economy and climat e-related 
public policies.” At present, only about half (48 percent) of LACERA’s public market holdings disclose carbon emissions.  We engage multiple vendors to aggregate reported emissions and 
model the remainder, including Scope 3 emissions  when not disc losed . 
 
Scope 3 emissions are an important baseline point of information for analysis.  We 
recognize that methodologies to estimate Scope 3 emissions are complex and evolving. It is important to note, however, that  Scope 3 emissions are estimated to account for the vast majority 
of our diversified portfolio emissions exposures (estimated to be over 80% ). Moreover, Scope 3 
emissions implicate sectors and industries where Scope 1 and 2 emissions may be minimal. In 
other words, business sectors with seemingly low emissions may in fact be impacted by transition 
risk across their full value chain. Accordi ngly, any individual security analysis or  full portfolio 
assessment of aggregate value- at-risk to climate -related factors  may be incomplete without 
considering Scope 3 emissions.  
 
We therefore welcome the Proposed Rules’ incorporation of guidance to facilitate 
availability of baseline data used by providers of capital to analyze security and portfolio 
investment risks , including meaningful disclosure of emissions across the full scope of the value 
chain.   
 
3. Pragmatic Transition and Safe Harbor Provisions to Facilitate Meaningful Adoption  
 
We consider it appropriate for the Proposed Rules to provide a  phase- in period for 
reporting requirements and safe harbor  protections. We appreciate the Commission’s 
consideration of our comments in our June 2021 Letter and continue to believe it is important to strike an appropriate balance between the market demand and urgency for consistent, 
comparable, and reliable climate risk disclosures and appropriate timeframes and reasonable 
safe harbors from legal liabilities that support meaningful disclosures  as climate reporting 
methodologies improve and evolve.  
 
4. Assurance and Verification  
 
We also  reiterate our support, as referenced in our June 2021 Letter, for effective measures 
that enhance reliability, such as assurance. We w elcome the Proposed Rules’ considerations for 
assurance and attestation and we incorporate, by reference, comments provided by the Counc il 
of Institutional Investors  on these points, encouraging a “requirement that the attestation report 
must be prepared pursuant to standards that are established by a body or group that has followed 
due process procedures, including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment.”

5. Identifying and Mitigating Unintended Consequences 
 We encourage the Commission to identify and mitigate any unintended consequences in 
the Proposed Rules’ provisions that may undermine the stated objective of enhancing availability 
of consistent, reliable, and comparable data to market participants on climate risks.  
 By way of example, we reference the Proposed Rules’ provisions by which certain 
registrants would be required to disclose Scope 3 emissions only if they have adopted related 
reduction targets and certain registrants to report scenario analyses only if they have conducted 
such analysis.
11 We welcome prudent forward -looking planning by portfolio holdings (including 
analysis and performance targets). We welcome regulatory guidance for meaningful disclosure 
of material risks, in line with the TCFD, while not creating a disincentive for an entity that has yet to develop related reduction targets or conduct scenario analysis to avoid or limit such analysis in 
scope or rigor . 
 Similarly, the economic and financial impacts of climate- related risks and opportunities 
span our full portfolio, including across both public and private markets. In the effort to enhance 
consistency, comparability, and reliability of climate- related financial risks, market participants 
such as diversified public pensions would not be well -served if such assets are simply transferred 
from public to  private markets. We encourage the Commission to give consideration to effective 
measures by which enhanced public company climate disclosures support the Commission’s 
broader mission to facilitate capital formation and market integrity across all financial markets , 
enhanced by greater clarity of investment risks such as those related to climate, without 
concentrating opacity of climate risks within any segment of financial markets . 
 
### 
 
We commend the Commission for soliciting market input  on the Proposed Rules to 
enhance the availability of consistent, comparable, and reliable disclosures to market participants 
on climate -related financial risks and opportunities. We believe the aim of the Proposed Rules to 
be timely and wholly in line with the SEC’s mission to protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital formation . We welcome the Commission’s consideration of 
our comments to avail meaningful in formation to enhance our investment decisions and 
strengthen our position to fulfi ll our fiduciary duties to produce and protect financial returns.

Re: The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate -Related Disclosures for Investors (File 
Number S7 -10-22) 
 
Dear Ms. Countryman,  
 
UNITE HERE strongly  supports the SECs’ efforts to update issuer disclosure requirements on 
climate change. As the Union of hospitality workers, we’re on the frontlines of climate change. 
Our service -based industry cannot ignore the impact of climate change on employees, the 
single largest factor in operations. Not only is the fate of industry employees tightly bound up 
with how employers respond to climate change, our members, disproportionately low -income 
workers of color and immigrants, are often the hardest hit when climat e change -related 
disasters strike.  
 
Representing our 300,000 members who work in the hospitality industry (hotels, gaming, and 
foodservice) UNITE HERE has consistently advocated for greater visibility of the climate -related 
impacts of travel and issuers p lans to mitigate risks related to climate change. Hospitality is a 
people -centered business, and it would be a grave error if hospitality companies omitted their 
workforce from their climate disclosures as has historically been the case. The SEC’s proposed  
rule on climate disclosure should create a reporting framework that gives hospitality investors 
consistent, comparable and decision -useful information for evaluating financial risk related to 
climate -change.1 In the case of climate change -related reporti ng, the SEC must  include required 
reporting on the workforce, the single largest factor of operations in service industries like 
hospitality.  
 
Climate risks and operational structures differ considerably between industries and the SEC 
should adjust for these differences in its final policy. Given the centrality of the workforce in 
hospitality’s service -intensive industry, investors and the public  require more than just 
disclosures about the industry’s physical plant. Hospitality investors require disclosures that 
incorporate a discussion of the climate related risks to its workforce, not just its buildings.  
The voluntary climate change -related di sclosures that are already happening at publicly traded 
hotel companies are inadequate and misleading. Without rigorous requirements, companies 
only report what puts them in the best light, not what is comprehensive and necessary. 
 
1 https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2022/33 -11042.pdf  Voluntary reports vary in  quality, are difficult to compare, and omit important information 
about the hotel workforce. Host Hotels & Resorts, the leading hotel REIT with over 79 
properties in their portfolio, reported only 165 employees in their 2021 ESG report.2 At the 
same time , Host says in its 10 -K that hotel labor is its greatest operating expense, amounting to 
nearly 60% of costs.3 These omissions underscore why the SEC must require climate -risk 
disclosures for the hotel industry that give investors insight into issuers’ pl ans to mitigate 
climate -driven risks related to their workforce.   
 
As hotel industry issuers and investors examine climate risks specific to their sector – physical 
risks, regulatory risks, transition risks, changing consumer preferences, and technologica l 
changes – a key consideration is how to analyze these risks across the fissured employment 
structure of the industry where the operator is often a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that 
contracts out the day -to-day management of its properties to a thi rd-party manager acting as 
titular employer.4 This problem was documented in two recent articles by Columbia Business 
School Professor Shiva Rajgopal, who pointed out that the investor disclosures of the largest 
hospitality REIT, Host Hotels and Resorts, fails to even acknowledge the existence of the 
thousands of employees who deliver its product.5 Rajgopal found a similar problem in the 
industry’s largest employer, Marriott, whose disclosures cover only an estimated one in six 
employees due to franchisin g.6 
 
Given the unique operational structure of REIT -owned hotels, where REITs control operational 
decisions through budget approval rights, UNITE HERE believes that climate disclosures for 
hotel REITS should increase visibility on the full range of emissions generated in a hotel value 
chain. This includes overall hotel energy consumption and emissions, as well as breakouts of 
emissions arising from single -use paper and plastic, laundry and food service, staff commutes, 
the transport of goods, and the  disposal of waste.7   
 
Unlike most REITs, where tenant emissions are the result of the conduct of a third party, some 
hotel REITs maintain financial control over the operators in their properties through 
management agreements that reserve the right to ap prove operating budgets. For example, a 
2020 10 -K filing from RLJ Lodging Trust describe s the control over the properties they exert 
through management agreements:

key aspects of each hotel's operation, including, among others, revenue management, 
market positioning, cost structure, capital and operational budgeting, as well as the 
identification and evaluation of return on investment initiatives and overall business 
strategy.”8 
 
We urge the SEC to implement climate disclosure in the hotel industry that matches the specifi c 
ownership structure of the industry, where the hotel owner, often a publicly -traded REIT, exerts 
substantial influence or control over hotel operations. Investors need clear and comparable 
climate metrics related to the hotel workforce in REIT -owned hote ls in order to evaluate 
corporate issuers’ plans to mitigate climate risk and implement a just transition. These 
disclosures related to the hotel workforce are particularly important in the service -driven 
hospitality sector, where labor is the primary expe nditure, and asset owners bear the entire 
cost of maintaining a workforce.

 Many thanks to the SEC for proposing that publicly traded companies measure and disclose greenhouse gas emissions  As a constituent, a supporter of climate justice, and an investor in ESG funds, I am writing to commend your agencys proposal to require this disclosure.

Climate change is an existential threat to our economy, to the planet, and to the lives and well-being of all Earth's inhabitants. The financial risks posed by climate change to investors, other market participants, and the economy are real and well documented.

Not paying attention to climate change puts businesses, jobs, lives and livelihoods at risk. This is the right step to provide investors and other market participants with clear, consistent, and comprehensive information so we can make informed investment decisions.

Shareholders need to understand risks of the companies we are investing in, so we can support businesses that are \""doing the right things\"" to protect the environment via clean energy development and eventual elimination of fossil fuels, and to promote racial and social justice."

Dear Ms. Countryman and Ms. Muti, 

This delivering email and the attached six documents collectively form my joint submission to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and to the SEC-regulated credit rating company Moody's Investors Service. 

The joint submission constitutes: 
(1) My petition for the U.S. Securities and Exchange to ban the flip clause in the United States of America; 
and 
(2) My response to Moody's Investors Service regarding its Request for Comment ""General Principles for Assessing ESG -- Structured Finance Annex"" of June 6, 2022. My response exhorts Moody’s Investors Service to neutralize the flip clause globally by amending its proposed ESG methodology for structured finance. 

Here’s why joint action by both the SEC and Moody’s is necessary.
The SEC regulates certain providers of a swap with a flip clause, whereas Moody’s assigns structured finance ratings to most structured finance transactions globally that are or can be end-users of a swap with a flip clause.

The joint submission copies the respective supervisory offices for credit rating companies at the SEC, the European Securities and Markets Authority, and the UK Financial Conduct Authority. The regulators knowingly greenlight credit rating companies to deceive the public and undermine economic efficiency by relentlessly purveying flip clause misinformation. As a result, credit rating companies continuously adulterate credit rating methodologies, inflate credit ratings, and vitiate credit rating announcements by infesting them with flip clause falsehoods. 

By operation of law and of policy, the SEC must either make the joint submission publicly available on the “Petitions for Rulemaking Submitted to the SEC” tab or immediately inform me as to why not. I have re-submitted the petition several times since January 17, 2022, to perfect it to SEC requirements. 

I also provided Moody’s with the joint submission via its “Request for Comment“ page on July 21, 2022, at 8:20 pm EDST. I insist that Moody’s make the joint submission publicly available via an operational link on the same tab. In the past, Moody’s has blocked access to my critiques of its ESG methodologies by assigning them inoperative links. 

Best regards,

The Honorable Gary Gensler 
Chair 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
100 F. Street NE 
Washington, D.C. 20549 
Dear Chair Gensler: July 20, 2022 
We write concerning the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission's (SEC) proposed rule titled, The 
Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, 1 and in particular the 
impact the rule would have on small, private firms. RANKING MEMBER 
The proposed rule would require publicly traded companies to disclose enhanced climate-related 
information , including greenhous e gas (GHG) emissions as part of their Scope 1 and Scope 2 disclosures, 
respectively. The proposed rule goes one step further by requiring registrants to disclose Scope 3 
emissions which would include ""all indirect GHG emissions not otherwise included in a registrant's 
Scope 2 emissions , which occur in the upstream and downstream activities of a registrant's value chain.""2 
Scope 3 emission information requirements threaten to extend GHG disclosures well beyond the SEC 
registrants to nearly every privately owned entity in the country, including countless small firms who 
often do not have the necessary resources to comply with the significant demands of scope 1 and 2 
disclosures. For example, any manufacturer in the country who supplies parts to a publicly traded 
company would be required to supply GHG emission disclosures as part of the Scope 3 emission 
requirements of the publicly traded company. In addition, any farm that supplies feed to a publicly traded 
company would similarly be required to supply GHG emissions information to comply with the scope 3 
requirements as a part of the ""value chain"" of a publicly traded company. 
These real-world examples are just a fraction of the many instances where small businesses and private 
entities will be forced to determine GHG emissions as part of their business relationships with publicly 
traded companie s. However, the impact of the SEC's proposed rule is considerably broader when you 
take into account the impact of scope 3 emission on the value chain of financial institutions. 
Under the proposed rule, value chain is defined as ""the upstream and downstream activities related to a 
registrant's operations. ""3 For financial institutions participating in small business lending, this definition 
1 The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, 87 Fed. Reg. 21,334 (Apr. 11, 
2022). 
2 /d. at§ 229.lS0O(r). 
3 Id at (t). would include the countless small businesses who have received financing from a publicly traded 
financial institution. Publicly traded banks often have numerous and abundant relationships with small 
business customers, with some financial institutions having more than one million small business 
customers. As a result, this rule could have a significant impact on privately owned businesses and access 
to capital. 
The inability of small firms to produce this data and the wide reach of the proposed rule would not only 
burden small businesses, but also financial institutions. In public comment letters to the SEC multiple 
banking organizations pointed out their inability to collect GHG emission information from privately held 
companies. Furthermore , the lack of available data from private firms makes it nearly impossible for 
financial institutions to establish a comprehensive risk analysis. 
The Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy (Advocacy) was established by Congress to 
represent the views of small entities before Federal agencies and Congress. In fulfilling this duty, 
Advocacy submitted a comment letter to the proposed rule which directly states, ""The climate disclosure 
rules impose fixed costs that will fall disproportionately on small entities"" and ""Advocacy is concerned 
about the widespread economic impacts of the proposed climate disclosure rules on both public and 
privately owned small businesses.""4 
Not only does Advocacy highlight the dramatic impact on small firms, but it also highlights how the SEC 
failed to conduct an adequate Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRF A) as statutorily required under 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RF A). 5 Specifically, Advocacy states ""the IRF A in the proposed rules 
lacks essential information required under the RF A,""6 and even more alarming, ""the proposal does not 
consider indirect impacts to privately owned businesses that are not generally subject to SEC regulation.""7 
Considering the importance of small businesses to the U.S. economy, the failure of the SEC to consider 
the impact of this rule on privately owned businesses and small firms is egregious. 
With 32.5 million small businesses operating in the United States,8small firms have an oversized impact 
on the economy by creating roughly two thirds of net new jobs since 19959 and representing 39.7 percent 
of private sector payroll.1° Currently, small businesses are facing extreme challenges under the Biden 
Administration through disconnected supply chains and inflation reaching 8.6 percent in May.11 Thus, it is 
no surprise that small business optimism is at its lowest point in 48 years.12 
As the U.S. economy struggles to recover, unleashing a devastating and an unrealistic climate disclosure 
regime that goes well beyond the publicly traded companies, impacting nearly every small business, is 
irresponsible. Small firms simply cannot afford the additiona l burdens of the proposed rule. It is for this

The Honorable Gary Gansler 
Chair 
Securities and Exchange Commission 
100 F Street NE 
Washington, DC 20549 
Dear Chair Gansler, July 19, 2022 
As the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues its review and evaluation of the 
proposed rule to ""Enhance and Standardize Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors,"" we urge 
the Commission to ensure that our agricultural community, particularly small farmers and 
producers, will not be negatively impacted by this rulemaking. While we applaud the goal of 
fostering transparency about carbon emissions amongst publicly traded companies, we fear that 
the rule as written may unintentionally penalize agricultural operations that lack the resources to 
meet the reporting requirements. 
Family farms and agricultural producers are the backbone of our rural economy in New 
Hampshire and across the country-they truly do feed America and much of the world. While 
these types of businesses would not be directly subject to the climate-related disclosure rule, they 
are often part of the supply chain of publicly traded companies who would be required to 
disclose their Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, to include entities in their supply 
chains. While there are some flexibilities around Scope 3, including a good faith clause and 
allowance for reporting emissions in ranges based upon estimates , we are concerned about the 
lack of clarity in this process and the possible ramifications this rule could cause. 
Understandably, most small agricultural operations have neither the staffing nor the resources to 
produce robust data on their climate emissions. We therefore believe it very possible that 
publicly traded companies would turn to larger-scale operations to provide the agricultural 
commodities in their supply chains because such large entities could more easily produce data 
that would strictly comply with the rule. There has already been an alarming degree of 
consolidation within the agricultural sector to date, and we have seen the negative results of that 
consolidation through broken and interrupted supply chains that hampered producers and 
consumers alike during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. We feel strongly that 
the Federal Government has an obligation to do all in its power to create a level playing field for 
smaller producers to remain viable. It is imperative that this rule be consistent with that 
objective. 
We also have concerns about what kind of and how much information agricultural producers 
would have to provide both SEC and the publicly traded companies with which they work. The 
PRINTED ON RECYCLED PAPER 
ES161539Commission should consider how any emissions data reported under this rule could impact the 
privacy of farmers and their operations. 
We recognize SEC's desire to implement these rules expeditiously, but we believe that a 
thorough review of the above concerns, along with a further extension of the public comment 
period, is in the best interests of the farmers and consumers that ·we represent. 
We appreciate your consideration of this request and look forward to your response.

Dear Madam Secretary:  
Re: Comments: File No. S7 -10-22: The Enhancement and S tandardization of Climate -Related 
Disclosures for Investors  
Minerva welcomes the Securities and Exchange Commission ’s (SEC)  proposed rules on ‘ The 
Enhancement and Standardization of Climate -Related Disclosures for Investors .’ Climate risks have 
clear finan cial implications for institutional investors and investors have a role to play in driving 
progress in the transition to a low -carbon world. Investors have various tools to utilise, including capital 
allocation decisions, stewardship, and engagement , and t he SEC should expect investors to use those 
tools.  
Since 1995, Minerva ’s has provided  objective and expert “Sustainable Stewardship ” services 
comprising  decision useful  ESG and proxy voting data as well a supporting vote agency management. 
To deliver timely TCFD -aligned data that supports clients’ stewardship and voting activities, instead of 
using  private questionnaires, Minerva puts itself in the shoes of the typical sh areholder and  only uses 
publicly  available information sources, annual reports, proxy statements and company websites.  With 
up to 2,000 individual data points collected and analysed per company, we fully leverage the power of 
technology and data science to  provide truly expert analysis. We have been finessing our approach to 
sustainability data identification, capture, analysis,  and presentation for 27 years.  Uniquely, Minerva 
enables clients to have complete flexibility over the models and how they i ntegra tion. By which we 
mean that we do not have a “one size fits all” approach to governance and ESG models,  rather we offer 
a “custom as standard” approach . 
From a regulatory perspective, Minerva is a Stewardship Code signatory1 and a founder signatory of 
the Best Practices Principles Group for Shareholder Voting Research (BPPG)2. These self -regulatory 
frameworks address stewardship conduct issues covering conflicts of interest, transparency, service 
quality and engagement.  
Since 2015, the Minerva ’s “Say on Sustainability ” research module and associated voting guidelines 
have offered  consistent and comparable insights into the world’s largest compan ies approach to 
sustainability reporting disclosure quality  and are fully aligned to both the Transition Pathway 
Initiative3 (TPI)  and TCFD’s principles.  Our expert analysts have be en collating Scope 1, 2 and where 
available, Scope 3 disclosures  from public filings and so are well positioned to comment on the quality 
of data currently presented.

3 Home - Transition Pathw ay Initiative  In September 2021, Minerva announced its participation in the Glasgow Financial Alliance (GFANZ)4 
Net Zero  Financial Service Providers Alliance  (NZFSPA)5. Central to that commitment is the alignment 
of relevant products and services to support the scaling and mainstreaming of Paris Agreement 
alignment into the core of our business.  
Overall, we believe that the proposals put forward by the SEC will support investors’ needs for climate -
related data  and we applaud the SEC’s close alignment to existing international standards such as the 
TCFD and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol . Providing companies  with standardised definitions for key 
concepts  that are  consistent with international standards is a significant development for the global 
climate disclosure regime.  Importantly, in addition to supporting  standardisation, the SEC’s reporting 
process allows a comply or explain approach to disclosure, accommodating the varying approaches to 
measuring emissions and carbon footprint from sector to sector.  
Response to “ Requests for Comment #19 -23” 
Minerva stands  for evidence -based materiality disclosures. Therefore, we affirm  that the requirements 
proposed by the SEC and outlined within requests for comment #19 -23 should all be implemented in 
the final rule changes. Namely , the requirements for : 
• A registrant to d escribe the actual and potential impacts of its material climate -related risks 
on its strategy, business model, and outlook, as proposed? Should we require a registrant to 
disclose impacts from climate -related risks on, or any resulting significant changes  made to, its 
business operations, including the types and locations of its operations . 
• A registrant to disclose climate -related impacts on, or any resulting significant changes made 
to, its products or services, supply chain or value chain, activities to mitigate or adapt to 
climate -related risks, including adoption of new technologies or processes, expenditure for 
research and development, and any other significant changes or impacts . 
• A registrant to specify the time horizon applied when assessing its cli mate -related impacts . 
• A registrant to discuss whether and how it considers any of the described impacts as part of 
its business strategy, financial planning, and capital allocation . 
• A registrant to provide both current and forward -looking disclosures to fa cilitate an 
understanding of whether the implications of the identified climate -related risks have been 
integrated into the registrant’s business model or strategy . 
• The disclosures to include how the registrant is using resources to mitigate climate -relate d 
risks . 
If a registrant also employs green financial instruments such as green bonds, Minerva recommends 
that the SEC should require additional disclosure s providing key performance metrics tied to such 
financing instruments.  
 
4 Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (gfanzero.com)  
5 Committed to Net Zero - Net Zero Financial Service Providers Alliance (netzeroservic eproviders.com)  Response to “ Request for Comment #25 ” 
Further to Minerva’s support for evidence -based  materiality disclosure and  allowing for the differing 
approaches to climate disclosure by companies, Minerva agrees that the SEC should allow  registrants 
to provide a narrative discussion of whet her and how any of their identified climate -related risks have 
affected or are reasonably likely to affect their consolidated financial statements. This qualitative 
information should be supported by the quantitative financial statement metrics proposed by  the SEC 
in 17 CFR 210.14 -02 (14 -02 of Regulation S -X) that demonstrate that the identified climate -related risks 
have had a material impact on reported operations AND include tabular representations of those 
metrics.  
Response to “ Request for Comment #4 6” 
Regarding  the SEC’s requirements for registrants that have adopted transition plans, Minerva agrees  
that each such registrant should describe the plan, including the relevant metrics and targets used to 
identify and manage physical and transition risks, as  proposed. The SEC could take these disclosure 
requirements further by requiring registrants adhere to the Just Transition processes defined by the 
International Labor Organisation6.  
Furthermore, Minerva believes that transition plan  disclosure requirements should also be mandatory 
for ALL public  corporations , whether it is their equity or fixed i ncome instruments that are listed . If 
such  a corporation  does not currently have a transition plan in place, the SEC should require it to  
formulate  a plan  so that it can be  described to the SEC as part of its climate disclosure , including the 
relevant metrics and targets used to identify and manage physical and  transition risks . The threshold 
for an issuer  to be subject to such mandatory submission of a transition plan could be determined 
using reference to the Science -based Targets Initiative7. 
Response to “ Request for Comment #133 ” 
Minerva fully supports  the SEC’s ambition for mandating Scope 3 reporting from 2026 for large, 
accelerated filers, and 2027 for accelerated and non -accelerated filers . While these proposals go 
beyond the mandatory reporting requirements of the TCFD recommendations , there are many 
important and investment -performance aligned  benefits associated with measuring and reducing 
Scope 3 emissions. By measuring Scope 3 emissions, corporations  can:   
• assess where the emission hotspots are in their value chain;   
• identify resource and energy ri sks in their supply chain;   
• identify which suppliers are leaders and which are laggards in terms of their 
sustainability performance;  
• identify energy efficiency and cost reduction opportunities in their value chain;   
• engage suppliers and assist them to imp lement sustainability initiatives;   
• improve the energy efficiency of their products; and   
• positively engage with employees to reduce emissions from business travel and 
employee commuting.  
Due to the broader range of activities captured by Scope 3 emissions , we recognise that  most  
corporations  may not be prepared for such a high level of required reporting within the timeframe 
suggested. Instead, these reporting requirements are covered by safe harbour and exemption clauses, 
encouraging companies to report w hatever data they have.  
 
6 International Labor Organisation - Guidelines for a Just Transition  
7 Amb itious corporate climate action - Science Based Targets  While the proposals  may improve the availability of Scope 3 data , we are concerned by the lack of a 
definitive  timeline for fully liable scope 3 emissions disclosure. If such a sunset clause is not put in 
place, scope 3 reporting m ay become an exercise in box -ticking by companies.  
Response to “ Request for Comment #157 ” 
On the topic of assurance, Minerva agrees with the level of assurance that the SEC expects of 
registrants . However,  the proposals raise questions about the  capacity a nd capability of the US 
assurance market to meet the body of work that these requirements will bring . The mandatory 
minimum requirements set forth in the proposal, including the phased  implementation from limited 
to reasonable assurance, and the exemption of smaller filers, consider the needs of SEC registrants, 
but, based on the consultation do not appear to  address  the capacity and, very importantly,  the 
trustworthiness and reliabilit y of the US assurance market. Decisions about levels of assurance (limited 
or reasonable) to be applied should be based upon evaluation of the capacity of the assurance market. 
We do not believe that a ssurance costs should not be a concern as th ese can be  weighed against the 
cost of not having adequately reliable data for important risk evaluation.  "

The Honorable Gary Gensler  
Chair  
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  
100 F. Street NE  
Washington, D.C. 20549  
 
 
Dear Chair Gensler:  
 
We write concerning the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission ’s (SEC)  propose d rule titled, The  
Enhance ment  and Standardiz ation  of Climate -Related Disclosures for Investors ,1 and in particular the impact th e 
rule would have on small, private firms.  
 
The proposed rule would require publicly traded companies to disclose enhanced climate -related information, 
including  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of their Scope 1 and Scope 2 disclosures, respectively. The 
proposed rule goes one step f urther by re quiring registrants to disclose Scope 3 emissions which would include 
“all indirect GHG emissions not otherwise included in a registrant’s Scope 2 emissions, which occur in the 
upstream and downstream activities of a registrant’s value chain.”2 
 
Scope  3 emission  information r equirements  threaten to extend GHG disclos ures well beyond the SEC registrants 
to nearly every privately owned entity in the country, including countless small firms who  often  do not have the 
necessary resources to comply with the sign ificant demands of scope 1 and 2 disclosures. For example, any 
manufacturer in the country who supplies parts to a publicly traded company would be required to supply GHG 
emission  disclosures  as part of the Scope 3 emission requirements of the publicly tra ded company. In addition, 
any farm that supplies feed to a publicly traded company would similarly be required to supply GHG emissions 
information to comply with the scope 3 requirements as a part of the “value  chain” of a publicly traded 
company.  
 
These real-world  examples are just a fraction of the many instances where small businesses and private entities 
will be forced to determine GHG emissions as part of their  business  relationships with publicly traded 
companies. However, the impact of the S EC’s proposed rule is considerably broader  when you take into account 
the impact of scope 3 emission on the value chain of financial institutions.  
 
Under the proposed rule, value chain is defined as “the upstream and downstream activities related to a 
registrant’s operations. ”3 For financial institutions participating  in small business lending, this definition would 
include the countless small businesses who have received financing from a publicly traded financial institution . 
Publicly traded banks oft en have numerous and abundant relationships with small business customers, with 
some financial institutions having more than one million small business customers. As a result, this rule could 
have a significant impact on privately owned businesses and acce ss to capital.

small businesses, but  also financial institutions . In public comment letters to the SEC m ultiple  banking 
organizations pointed out their inability to collect GHG emission information from privately held companies. 
Furthermore, the lack of available data from private firms makes it nearly impossible for financial institutions to  
establish a comprehensive risk analysis.  
 
The Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy (Advocacy) was established by Congress to represent 
the views of small entities before Federal agencies and Congress. In fulfilling this duty, Advocacy submitted a 
comment letter to the propo sed rule which directly states,  “The climate disclosure rules impose fixed costs that 
will fall disproportionately on small entities” and “Advocacy is concerned about the widespread economic 
impacts of the proposed climate disclosure rules on both public a nd privately owned small businesses.”4 
 
Not only does Advocacy highlight the dramatic impact on small firms, but it  also highlights how the SEC failed 
to conduct an adequate Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) as statutorily required under the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA).5 Specifically, Advocacy states “the IRFA in the proposed rules lacks essential 
information required under the RFA,”6 and even more alarming , “the proposal does not consider indirect 
impacts to privately owned businesses that are not generally subject to SEC regulation.”7 Considering the 
importance of small businesses to the U.S. economy, the failure of the SEC to consider the impact of this rule on 
privately owned businesses and small firms is egregious.  
 
With  32.5 million small businesses  operating  in the United States ,8small firms have an oversized impact on the 
economy by creating roughly two thirds of net new jobs since 19959 and representing 39.7 percent of private 
sector payroll.10 Currently, small busi nesses are facing extreme challenges  under the Biden Administration  
through  disconnected supply chains and inflation reaching 8.6 percent in May .11 Thus, it is no surprise that small 
business optimism is at its lowest point in 48 years.12  
 
As the U.S. economy struggles to recover, unleashing a devastating  and an unrealistic  climate disclosure regime 
that goes well beyond the publicly traded companies, impa cting nearly every small business , is irresponsible . 
Small firms simply cannot afford the additional burdens of the proposed rule. It is for this reason and the reasons 
outline d in this letter, that w e ask that you rescind this proposed rule to protect sma ll businesses and allow them 
to drive the U.S. economy .

Dear Chair Gensler:  
On behalf of the SEC Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee, we are 
pleased to submit the below recommendation to the Commission, as approved at the Committee’s May 6, 2022 meeting.  
On March 21, 2022, the Commission proposed rules on the 
Enhancement and 
Standardization of Climate -Related Disclosures for Investors  ( Release No. 33 -11042).  
As the Commission works toward finalizing the proposed rules, while we recognize that 
climate is an important topic, we hope you will consider:  
• Providing a more detailed cost -benefit analysis, including the impact that the 
proposed rules would have on smaller public and private companies;  
• Scaling and delaying the compliance requirement for em erging growth 
companies, along with smaller reporting companies;  
• Expanding the safe harbor for liability for Scope 3 emissions disclosures to 
include all climate -related disclosures;  
• Eliminating the attestation requirement, as it would be costly and burden some, 
and it will delay reporting;  
• Requiring the information to be furnished, rather than filed;  
• Tailoring the requirements for certain industries;  
• Re-evaluating the timing for filing climate -related disclosures since the 
information may not be available in time for a company’s annual report on 
Form 10- K; and  
• Providing a longer implementation timeframe for the new rules, so that smaller 
companies would have more time to transition, work through implementation, 
and comply with the new requirements.1  
 
In addition, we ask that the Commission consider incentives, rather than penalties, for 
companies that are providing climate -related disclosures.  Companies that are moving in 
the direction of doing things that are more climate -friendly may, for instance, be deterred 
from putting together an analysis due to concerns of having to disclose it before it is 
finalized or concerns of being required to provide additional disclosures that could be 
financially costly and time -consuming.   
We also urge that the Commission consider how the climate -related disclosure 
requirements may deter private companies from going public.  There should be a 
pathway for very small companies to become public reporting companies without hiring 
expensive climate -related consultants.  
Finally, the Commission should consider the rule’s impact on small companies that are 
suppliers or vendors for public companies.  To the extent  public companies are required 
to track and provide downstream greenhouse gas emissions, smaller suppliers and 
vendo rs that are unable or delayed in providing their greenhouse gas emissions may lose 
business to larger companies that can provide such metrics.  Due to disadvantages arising 
from lack of resources and smaller operations scale, both small public and private 
                                                
1 Donnel Baird abstained from supporting the  Committee’s  recommendation of providing  a longer 
implementation timeframe for the new rules.   companies may face greater challenges in accessing capital and generating revenue they need to sustain their 
businesses.

Dear Chair Gensler:  
On behalf of the SEC Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee, we are pleased to submit the below 
recommendation to the Commission, as approved at the Committee’s May 6, 2022 meeting.  
On March 30, 2022, the Commission proposed rules on Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs), Shell 
Companies and Projections  (Release No. 33 -11048).  Our recommendations related to this proposal are as follows:2 
1. The Committee  would like for SPACs to remain a viable path for companies to pursue as a means of 
getting access to public market capital.  The Committee is concerned that the proposed rules, as written, 
might render SPACs unusable as an alternative to IPOs.   
 
2. The Committee is generally supportive of improving disclosures for SPACs, particularly in the period of 
time between the announcement of the merger and the closing of the de -SPAC transaction.   
 
3. The Committee encourages the Commission to clearly identify w hich participants would have underwriter 
liability.  Participants should be held accountable to the same extent they would be in traditional IPOs.  
 
4. Management projections are an important part of the rationale for companies in determining whether to engage in a merger with a SPAC, and they are necessary when financial intermediaries provide fairness opinions related to de -SPAC transactions.  As a result, the Committee recommends that the projections in 
de-SPAC transactions be covered by the liability safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation 
Reform Act when disclosed in the de -SPAC transaction.   
 
5. The Committee recommends that the Commission expand or eliminate the 18 month and 24 month timelines provided in the Investment Company Act safe  harbor for SPACs.  The requirement to engage in a 
de-SPAC transaction within 18 months after its IPO and complete its de -SPAC transaction within 24 
months could incentivize SPAC sponsors to engage in riskier acquisitions to complete the merger process within the artificially short periods.  
 
Respectfully submitted on behalf of the Advisory Committee,

Dear Secretary Countryman: 
The Attorneys General of the States of West Virginia, Arizona, Alabama, Alaska, 
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, 
Virginia, and Wyoming submit these additional comments on the Securities and Exchange 
Commission’s proposed rule, “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related 
Disclosures for Investors.”1  We submit these supplemental comments given an important post-
deadline development—a U.S. Supreme Court decision that confirms that the SEC should not 
finalize the Proposed Rule. 
In West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency ,2 the Court confirmed that 
Congress—not a federal administrative agency—has the power to decide major issues of the day.  
There, the Court rejected a “broader conception of EPA’s authority” that the EPA thought 
empowered it to effect sweeping changes in the nation’s power grid through an ambiguous 
provision of the Clean Air Act.3  Although EPA’s “regulatory assertion[] had a colorable textual 
basis,” the agency needed to identify something more than a “merely plausible textual basis” for 
1 87 Fed. Reg. 21,334 (Apr. 11, 2022) (“Proposed Rule”). 
2 No. 20-1530, 2022 WL 2347278 (U.S. June 30, 2022).

it to accomplish “radical or fundamental change to a statutory scheme.”4  The Court insisted that 
EPA “must point to clear congressional authorization for the power it claims.”5
Many things that should look familiar to the Commission established that EPA’s actions 
presented the sort of “extraordinary” case that requires more specific language: The agency had 
never before interpreted the statute that way, its understanding revised the nature of the statutory 
scheme itself, the action fell outside the realm of the agency’s ordinary expertise, the regulated 
issue was one so important that one would expect Congress to address it directly, and Congress 
had considered and rejected similar regulatory actions.6  At the same time, a “vague statutory 
grant” with some broad wording was not a clear enough statement from Congress to allow EPA to 
address these issues.7  Among other things, the nebulous wording in the statute at issue contrasted 
with more specific language that Congress had enacted in other provisions.8
West Virginia v. EPA thus confirms that “the major questions doctrine” operates as a 
“distinct” constraint on agency power.9
We explained in our earlier comment letter why the Commission’s Proposed Rule offends 
that doctrine,10 and West Virginia v. EPA confirms we were right.  Just as the EPA did, the 
Commission purports to “discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power.”11  Based on 
vague text,12 the SEC claims the right to reorder how publicly registered companies can operate.  
Businesses would be compelled to subordinate the shareholders’ interests to those of the regulators 
and their powerful backers.  And after adopting a paternalistic reading of its mandate, the 
Commission concludes that it can constrain how public companies function simply because 
influential institutional investors think it best to squeeze out disfavored, carbon-based energy 
sources.  If this sort of regulatory overreach does not constitute a sweeping policy judgment on a 
major question,13 then we struggle to see what would.

non-material, non-financial matters like those found in the Proposed Rule.14  Environmental 
regulation is outside the Commission’s area of expertise; if anything, the Commission is even less 
equipped to regulate in areas concerning climate change than EPA.  This issue—climate change—
is also the same issue deemed vitally important in West Virginia.  And Congress has considered 
and rejected similar disclosures on many prior occasions.15  Yet the Commission can point to no 
congressional authorization other than statutes concerning investor “protection” or the “public 
interest.”16  This language contrasts with the more specific language that Congress used to 
authorize EPA to enact limited climate disclosures.17  The Commission’s squishy language does 
not license the Commission to reorder the market in the way that the Proposed Rule would. 
Several years ago, many of us warned EPA that it was headed down an unlawful path.  The 
Supreme Court has now agreed.  If the Commission insists on taking the same inappropriate 
course, we will be ready to act once again.  We urge you to save everyone years of strife by 
abandoning the Proposed Rule.

Dear Secretary Vanessa Countryman, 
Investors are tired of watching their communities being reduced to ashes or washed 
away in floods caused by climate change and they're demanding companies to stop 
greenwashing projects that accelerate climate change. Climate risk is financial risk. 
Investors need transparency from U.S. companies on their greenhouse gas emissions 
and how they're addressing climate risk. By meeting investor demands for disclosure, 
transparent companies will be more competitive, innovative, and clean. This is a critical 
step to help companies get ready for a net zero carbon economy. 
I support the proposed rules change in S7-10-22. Please implement these changes as 
soon as possible. 
Sincerely, 
Monica Russ"

Environmental Protection Agency, No. 20–1530, 597 U.S. ___ (2022) (attached hereto as Exhibit A), and to demonstrate that this decision confirms the illegality of the SEC’s Proposed Rule on “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors” (“the proposed rule”), published in the Federal Register on April 11, 2022, at 87 Fed. Reg. at 21,334 through 21,473.  First, the Court resoundingly reaffirmed and clarified its major-questions doctrine. When “agencies assert[] highly consequential power beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted,” or “discover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power representing a transformative expansion of [] regulatory authority,” “there is every reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress meant to confer” the power claimed. West Virginia, 597 U.S. at ___ (slip op., at 20) (internal quotations and citations omitted). As my prior letter demonstrated, the proposed rule would impose regulations of vast economic and political significance, directly or indirectly affecting listed companies and every single link in those companies’ supply and distribution chains, right down to the everyday customer. The SEC estimates some $15.3 billion in compliance costs over the first five years, and over $3.5 billion in the first year alone. Yet the SEC claims statutory authority for this chasmic authority only from its generic—and limited—disclosure powers. This is not the “clear statement from Congress” that the major-questions doctrine requires. Chevron deference is therefore unavailable, and the rule if finalized would certainly fail in court.  Second, the Court explained that “[w]hen an agency has no comparative expertise in making certain policy judgments, . . . Congress presumably would not task it with doing so.” Id. at __ (slip op., at 25) (quoting Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S.Ct. 2400, 2418 (2019)).

a limited and focused mission: to regulate trade in financial products as such. But, as 
my prior letter argued, the SEC has no “comparative expertise” in climate, and 
Congress has specifically assigned this authority to another agency—the EPA—a fact 
that even the SEC tacitly acknowledges.1 This means that there is a strong 
presumption that Congress did not grant the SEC authority to mandate climate-
related risk disclosures, a presumption that is in no way rebutted by the Securities 
Act or Exchange Act.

1 Throughout the proposed rule, the SEC defers to EPA definitions of what counts as a

the concepts of Scope 1, 2, and 3, id. at 21,374. And despite prominent reporting to the contrary, West 
Virginia  did not revisit whether EPA has authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the 
Clean Air Act. Rather, the Court held that a cap-and-trade “generation shifting” program was not the 
kind of “system” that Section 111 of the Clean Air Act can fairly be read to authorize.   Exhibit A

WEST VIRGINIA  ET AL . v. ENVIRONMENTAL 
PROTECTION AGENCY  ET AL . 
CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR 
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT 
No. 20–1530. Argued February 28, 2022—Decided June 30, 2022* 
In 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the 
Clean Power Plan rule, which addr essed carbon dioxide emissions 
from existing coal- and natural-gas-fired power plants.  For authority, 
the Agency cited Section 111 of th e Clean Air Act, which, although
known as the New Source Performance Standards program, also au -
thorizes regulation of certain pollutants from existing  sources under 
Section 111(d).  42 U. S. C. §7411(d).  Prior to the Clean Power Plan, EPA had used Section 111(d) only a handful of times since its enact-
ment in 1970.  Under that provision, although the States set the actual
enforceable rules governing existing sources (such as power plants),EPA determines the emissions limit with which they will have to com-
ply.  The Agency derives that limit by determining the “best system of
emission reduction . . . that has been  adequately demonstrated,” or the 
BSER, for the kind of existing source at issue.  §7411(a)(1).  The limit 
then reflects the amount of polluti on reduction “achievable through the 
application of” that system.  Ibid. 
In the Clean Power Plan, EPA de termined that the BSER for exist-
ing coal and natural gas plants in cluded three types of measures, 
which the Agency called “building blocks.”  80 Fed. Reg. 64667.  The 
first building block was “heat ra te improvements” at coal-fired 
plants—essentially practices such plan ts could undertake to burn coal

more cleanly. Id., at 64727 . This sort of source-specific, efficiency-
improving measure was similar in ki nd to those that EPA had previ-
ously identified as the BSER in other Section 111 rules.  
Building blocks two and three were  quite different, as both involved 
what EPA called “generation shifting” at the grid level— i.e., a shift in 
electricity production from higher-e mitting to lower-emitting produc -
ers. Building block two was a shift in generation  from existing coal-
fired power plants, which would make less power, to natural-gas-fired 
plants, which would make more.  Ibid. This would reduce carbon di-
oxide emissions because natural gas plants produce less carbon dioxide 
per unit of electricity generated than coal plants.  Building block three 
worked like building block two, except that the shift was from both coal
and gas plants to renewables, mostly wind and solar. Id., at 64729, 
64748.  The Agency explained that, to implement the needed shift in
generation to cleaner sources, an operator could reduce the regulated 
plant’s own production of electricity, build or in vest in a new or exist-
ing natural gas plant, wind farm, or  solar installation, or purchase 
emission allowances or credits as part of a cap-and-trade regime.  Id., 
at 64731–64732.  Taking any of th ese steps would implement a sector-
wide shift in electricity production from coal to natural gas and renew-
ables.  Id., at 64731.   
Having decided that the BSER was one that would reduce carbon 
pollution mostly by moving producti on to cleaner sources, EPA then 
set about determining “the degree of  emission limitation achievable 
through the application” of that syst em.  §7411(a)(1). The Agency rec-
ognized that, in translating the BS ER into an operational emissions
limit, it could choose whether to requ ire anything from a little genera -
tion shifting to a great deal.  It se ttled on what it regarded as a “rea-
sonable” amount of shift, which it  based on modeling how much more
electricity both natural gas and renewable sources could supply with -
out causing undue cost increases or reducing the overall power supply. 
Id., at 64797–64811.  The Agency ultimately projected, for instance, 
that it would be feasible to have co al provide 27% of national electricity
generation by 2030, down from 38% in 2014.  From these projected 
changes, EPA determined the applic able emissions performance rates,
which were so strict that no existing coal plant would have been able to achieve them without engaging in  one of the three means of gener-
ation shifting.  The Government proj ected that the rule would impose
billions in compliance costs, raise re tail electricity prices, require the 
retirement of dozens of coal plants, and eliminate tens of thousands ofjobs.   
This Court stayed the Clean Power Plan in 2016, preventing the rule
from taking effect.  It was later repealed after a change in Presidential administrations.  Specifically, in 2019, EPA found that the Clean

Power Plan had exceeded the Agency ’s statutory authority under Sec-
tion 111(d), which it interpreted to “limit[ ] the BSER to those systems
that can be put into operation at a building, structur e, facility, or in-
stallation.”  84 Fed. Reg. 32524.  EPA explained that the Clean Power 
Plan, rather than setting the standa rd “based on the application of
equipment and practices at the level of an individual facility,” had in-
stead based it on “a shift in the energy generation mix at the grid 
level,” id., at 32523.  The Agency determined that the interpretive
question raised by the Clean Power Plan fell under the major questions 
doctrine.  Under that doctrine, it determined, a clear statement is nec-essary for a court to conclude that  Congress intended to delegate au-
thority “of this breadth to regulate  a fundamental sector of the econ-
omy.” Id., at 32529.  It found none.  The Agency replaced the Clean 
Power Plan by promulgating a different Section 111(d) regulation, 
known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule.  Id., at 32532. In 
that rule, EPA determined that th e BSER would be akin to building 
block one of the Clean Power Plan: a combination of equipment up -
grades and operating practices that would improve facilities’ heat 
rates. Id., at 32522, 32537. 
A number of States and private pa rties filed petitions for review in 
the D. C. Circuit, challenging EPA’ s repeal of the Clean Power Plan 
and its enactment of th e replacement ACE rule. The Court of Appeals
consolidated the cases and held that EPA’s “repeal of the Clean Power 
Plan rested critically on a mistaken reading of the Clean Air Act”—
namely, that generation shifting cannot be a “system of emission re -
duction” under Section 111. 985 F. 3d 914, 995.  The court vacated the 
Agency’s repeal of the Clean Power Plan and remanded to the Agency 
for further consideration. It also vacated and remanded the ACE rule for the same reason. The court’s decision was followed by another 
change in Presidential administra tions, and EPA moved the court to 
partially stay its mandate as to th e Clean Power Plan while the Agency 
considered whether to promulgate a new Section 111(d) rule.  No party
opposed the motion, and the Court of Appeals agreed to stay its vaca -
tur of the Agency’s repeal of the Clean Power Plan. 
Held : 
1. This case remains justiciable notwithstanding the Government’s
contention that no petitioner ha s Article III standing, given EPA’s 
stated intention not to enforce th e Clean Power Plan and to instead 
engage in new rulemaking.  In considering standing to appeal, the 
question is whether the appellant has experienced an injury “fairly 
traceable to the judgment below.”  Food Marketing Institute  v. Argus 
Leader Media , 588 U. S. ___, ___.  If so, and a “favorable ruling” from
the appellate court “would redress [t hat] injury,” then the appellant
has a cognizable Article III stake.  Ibid.   Here, the judgment below

Syllabus 
vacated the ACE rule and its embedded repeal of the Clean Power 
Plan, and accordingly purports to bring the Clean Power Plan back
into legal effect. There is little ques tion that the petitioner States are 
injured, since the rule requires them to more stringently regulate 
power plant emissions within their borders.  The Government counters 
that EPA’s current posture has mooted  the prior dispute.  The distinc-
tion between mootness and standing  matters, however, because the 
Government bears the burden to establish that a once-live case has become moot.  The Government’s argu ment in this case boils down to
its representation that EPA does no t intend to enforce the Clean Power
Plan prior to promulgating a new Section 111(d) rule.  But “voluntary cessation does not moot a case” unless it is “absolutely clear that the 
allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.” 
Parents Involved in Community Schools  v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1, 
551 U. S. 701, 719.  Here, the Government “nowhere suggests that ifthis litigation is resolved in its fa vor it will not” reimpose emissions
limits predicated on generation shifting. Ibid. Pp. 14–16.
2. Congress did not grant EPA in Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act 
the authority to devise emissions caps  based on the generation shifting 
approach the Agency took in th e Clean Power Plan.  Pp. 16–31.
(a) In devising emissions limits for power plants, EPA “deter-
mines” the BSER that—taking into account cost, health, and other fac-tors—it finds “has been adequately  demonstrated,” and then quanti-
fies “the degree of emission limitation achievable” if that best system were applied to the covered source. §7411(a)(1). The issue here is whether restructuring the Nation’s overall mix of electricity genera-
tion, to transition from 38% to 27% coal by 2030, can be the BSER within the meaning of Section 111.  
Precedent teaches that there are “extraordinary cases” in which the 
“history and the breadth of the au thority that [the agency] has as-
serted,” and the “economic and political significance” of that assertion,provide a “reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress” meant to confer such authority. FDA  v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 
529 U. S. 120, 159–160.  See, e.g., Alabama Assn. of Realtors  v. Depart-
ment of Health and Human Servs., 594 U. S. ___, ___; Utility Air Reg-
ulatory Group  v. EPA,  573 U. S. 302, 324; Gonzales  v. Oregon , 546 
U. S. 243, 267; National Federation of Independent Business v. OSHA , 
595 U. S. ___, ___.  Under this body of law, kn own as the major ques-
tions doctrine, given both separation  of powers principles and a prac-
tical understanding of legislative intent, the agency must point to 
“clear congressional authorization” for the authority it claims.  Utility 
Air, 573 U. S., at 324.  Pp. 16–20.

unheralded power representing a tran sformative expansion of its reg-
ulatory authority in the vague language of a long-extant, but rarely 
used, statute designed as a gap fille r.  That discovery allowed it to
adopt a regulatory program that Congress had conspicuously declined
to enact itself.  Given these circum stances, there is every reason to 
“hesitate before concluding that Co ngress” meant to confer on EPA the 
authority it claims under Section 111(d). Brown & Williamson , 529 
U. S., at 160. 
Prior to 2015, EPA had always set Section 111 emissions limits 
based on the application of measures  that would reduce pollution by 
causing the regulated source to  operate more cleanly, see, e.g. , 41 Fed. 
Reg. 48706—never by looking to a “system” that would reduce pollu -
tion simply by “shifting” polluting activity “from dirtier to cleaner sources.”  80 Fed. Reg. 64726.  The Government quibbles with this his-
tory, pointing to the 2005 Mercury Rule as one Section 111 rule that it
says relied upon a cap-and-trade mechanism to reduce emissions.  See 70 Fed. Reg. 28616.  But in that regulation, EPA set the emissions
limit—the “cap”—based on the use of “technologies [that could be] in-
stalled and operational on a nationwide basis” in the relevant timeframe.  Id., at 28620–28621.  By contrast, and by design, there are 
no particular controls a coal plant operator can install and operate to attain the emissions limits establis hed by the Clean Power Plan.  In-
deed, the Agency nodded to the nove lty of its approach when it ex-
plained that it was pursuing a “broader, forward-thinking approach to the design” of Section 111 regulations that would “improve the overall 
power system ,” rather than the emission s performance of individual
sources, by forcing a shift throughout  the power grid from one type of 
energy source to another.  80 Fed. Reg. 64703 (emphasis added).  This view of EPA’s authority was not only unprecedented; it also effected a 
“fundamental revision of the statute,  changing it from [one sort of] 
scheme of . . . regulation” into an entirely different kind.  MCI Tele -
communications Corp.  v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co.,  512 
U. S. 218, 231. 
The Government attempts to down play matters, noting that the 
Agency must limit the magnitude of generation shift it demands to a 
level that will not be “exorbitantl y costly” or “threaten the reliability 
of the grid.” Brief for Federal Re spondents 42.  This argument does
not limit the breadth of EPA’s claimed authority so much as reveal it: 
On EPA’s view of Section 111(d), Co ngress implicitly tasked it, and it
alone, with balancing the many vital considerations of national policy 
implicated in the basic regulation of how Americans get their energy. 
There is little reason to think Congress did so.  EPA has admitted that 
issues of electricity transmission , distribution, and storage are not 
within its traditional expertise.  An d this Court doubts that “Congress

. . . intended to delegate . . . decision[s] of such economic and political significance,” i.e., how much coal-based generation there should be 
over the coming decades, to any administrative agency. Brown & Wil-
liamson , 529 U. S., at 160.  Nor can the Court ignore that the regula-
tory writ EPA newly uncovered in Se ction 111(d) conveniently enabled
it to enact a program, namely, cap-and-trade for carbon, that Congresshad already considered and rejected  numerous times.  The importance
of the policy issue and ongoing de bate over its merits “makes the 
oblique form of the claimed delegation all the more suspect.”  Gonzales , 
546 U. S., at 267–268.  Pp. 20–28.   
(c) Given that precedent counsels skepticism toward EPA’s claim 
that Section 111 empowers it to devi se carbon emissions caps based on
a generation shifting approach, the Government must point to “clearcongressional authorization” to  regulate in that manner. Utility Air , 
573 U. S., at 324.  The Government can offer only EPA’s authority to establish emissions caps at a level reflecting “the application of the
best system of emission reduction . . . adequately demonstrated.” 
§7411(a)(1).  The word “system” shor n of all context, however, is an 
empty vessel.  Such a vague statutory grant is not close to the sort of
clear authorization required. The Government points to other provi-
sions of the Clean Air Act—specifically the Acid Rain and National 
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) programs—that use the
word “system” or “similar words” to describe sector-wide mechanisms 
for reducing pollution.  But just because a cap-and-trade “system” can
be used to reduce emissions does not mean that it is the kind of “system
of emission reduction” referred to in Section 111. 
Finally, the Court has no occasion to decide whether the statutory 
phrase “system of emission reduction” refers exclusively  to measures 
that improve the pollution performance of individual sources, such that all other actions are ineligible to qualify as the BSER.  It is perti-
nent to the Court’s analysis that EPA has acted consistent with such 
a limitation for four decades.  But the only question before the Courtis more narrow: whether the “best syst em of emission reduction” iden-
tified by EPA in the Clean Powe r Plan was within the authority 
granted to the Agency in Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act.  For the reasons given, the answer is no.  Pp. 28–31.

Court.

of performance” for their emission of certain pollutants into

Opinion of the Court 
the air. 84 Stat. 1683, 42 U. S. C. §7411(a)(1).  That stand-
ard may be different for new and existing plants, but in 
each case it must reflect the “best system of emission reduc-tion” that the Agency has determined to be “adequately 
demonstrated” for the particular category. §§7411(a)(1),
(b)(1), (d). For existing plants, the States then implement 
that requirement by issuing rules restricting emissions 
from sources within their borders. 
Since passage of the Act 50 years ago, EPA has exercised 
this authority by setting pe rformance standards based on 
measures that would reduce pollution by causing plants tooperate more cleanly. In 2015, however, EPA issued a new 
rule concluding that the “best system of emission reduction”
for existing coal-fired power plants included a requirement
that such facilities reduce their own production of electric-ity, or subsidize increased generation by natural gas, wind,or solar sources. 
The question before us is whether this broader conception
of EPA’s authority is within the power granted to it by the 
Clean Air Act. 
I 
A 
The Clean Air Act establishes three main regulatory pro-
grams to control air pollution from stationary sources suchas power plants. Clean Air Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 
1676, 42 U. S. C. §7401 et seq. One program is the New 
Source Performance Standards program of Section 111, at
issue here.  The other two are the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) program, set out in Sections
108 through 110 of the Act, 42 U. S. C. §§7408–7410, and 
the Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) program, set out in Section 112, §7412. To understand the place and function
of Section 111 in the statutory scheme, some background on 
the other two programs is in order.
The NAAQS program addresses air pollutants that “may

Opinion of the Court 
reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or wel-
fare,” and “the presence of wh ich in the ambient air results
from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources.”
§7408(a)(1). After identifying such pollutants, EPA estab-
lishes a NAAQS for each. The NAAQS represents “the max-
imum airborne concentration of [the] pollutant that the
public health can tolerate.” Whitman  v. American Trucking 
Assns. , Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 465 (2001); see §7409(b).  EPA, 
though, does not choose which sources must reduce theirpollution and by how much to meet the ambient pollution 
target. Instead, Section 110 of the Act leaves that task in 
the first instance to the States, requiring each “to submit to
[EPA] a plan designed to implement and maintain such standards within its boundaries.” Train  v. Natural Re-
sources Defense Council , Inc., 421 U. S. 60, 65 (1975); §7410.
The second major program governing stationary sources
is the HAP program.  The HAP program primarily targetspollutants, other than those already covered by a NAAQS,
that present “a threat of adverse human health effects,” in-
cluding substances known or anticipated to be “carcino -
genic, mutagenic, teratogenic, neurotoxic,” or otherwise 
“acutely or chronically toxic.”  §7412(b)(2).
EPA’s regulatory role with respect to these toxic pollu-
tants is different in kind from its role in administering the 
NAAQS program.  There, EPA is generally limited to deter-mining the maximum safe amount of covered pollutants in
the air. As to each hazardous pollutant, by contrast, the 
Agency must promulgate emissions standards for both new 
and existing major sources.  §7412(d)(1).  Those standards 
must “require the maximum degree of reduction in emis-sions . . . that the [EPA] Administrator, taking into consid-
eration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, and 
any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and 
energy requirements, determines is achievable . . . through
application of measures, proc esses, methods, systems or 
techniques” of emission reduction.  §7412(d)(2). In other   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 4 WEST VIRGINIA v. EPA 
Opinion of the Court 
words, EPA must directly requi re all covered sources to re -
duce their emissions to a certain level.  And it chooses that 
level by determining the “maximum degree of reduction” it considers “achievable” in practice by using the best existing
technologies and methods. §7412(d)(3). 
Thus, in the parlance of environmental law, Section 112
directs the Agency to impose “ technology-based  standard[s]
for hazardous emissions,” Alaska Dept. of Environmental 
Conservation  v. EPA , 540 U. S. 461, 485, n. 12 (2004) (em-
phasis added). This sort of “ ‘technology-based’ approach fo-
cuses upon the control technologies that are available to in-
dustrial entities and requires the agency to . . . ensur[e]
that regulated firms adopt the appropriate cleanup technol-
ogy.” T. McGarity, Media-Q uality, Technology, and Cost-
Benefit Balancing Strategies for Health and Environmen-
tal Regulation, 46 Law & Contemp. Prob. 159, 160 (Summer 1983) (McGarity). (Such “technologies” are not limited to
literal technology, such as s crubbers; “changes in the design 
and operation” of the facility, or “in the way that employees 
perform their tasks,” are also available options.  Id. , at 163, 
n. 18.)
The third air pollution control scheme is the New Source
Performance Standards program of Section 111. §7411.
That section directs EPA to list “categories of stationary
sources” that it determines “cause[ ], or contribute[ ] signifi-
cantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated 
to endanger public health or welfare.”  §7411(b)(1)(A).  Un-
der Section 111(b), the Agency must then promulgate for 
each category “Federal standards of performance for new
sources,” §7411(b)(1)(B). A “standard of performance” isone that 
“reflects the degree of emission limitation achievablethrough the application of the best system of emission reduction which (taking into account the cost of achiev-
ing such reduction and any nonair quality health and   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  5 Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 
Opinion of the Court 
environmental impact and energy requirements) the 
[EPA] Administrator determines has been adequately 
demonstrated.” §7411(a)(1). 
Thus, the statute directs EPA to (1) “determine[ ],” taking
into account various factors, the “best system of emissionreduction which . . . has been adequately demonstrated,” 
(2) ascertain the “degree of emission limitation achievable
through the application” of that system, and (3) impose an
emissions limit on new stationary sources that “reflects” 
that amount. Ibid.; see also 80 Fed. Reg. 64538 (2015). 
Generally speaking, a source may achieve that emissions cap any way it chooses; the key is that its pollution be no
more than the amount “achievable through the applicationof the best system of emission reduction . . . adequately
demonstrated,” or the BSER.  §7411(a)(1); see §7411(b)(5).
EPA undertakes this analysis on a pollutant-by-pollutant 
basis, establishing different standards of performance with
respect to different pollutants emitted from the same source 
category. See, e.g., 73 Fed. Reg. 35838 (2008); 42 Fed. Reg. 
22510 (1977).
Although the thrust of Section 111 focuses on emissions
limits for new and modified sources—as its title indicates— 
the statute also authorizes regulation of certain pollutantsfrom existing  sources. Under Section 111(d), once EPA “has 
set new source standards addressing emissions of a partic-
ular pollutant under . . . section 111(b),” 80 Fed. Reg. 64711, 
it must then address emission s of that same pollutant by 
existing sources—but only if they are not already regulatedunder the NAAQS or HAP programs.  §7411(d)(1). Existing
power plants, for example, emit  many pollutants covered by 
a NAAQS or HAP standard.  Section 111(d) thus “operates 
as a gap-filler,” empowering EPA to regulate harmful emis -
sions not already controlled under the Agency’s other au-thorities. American Lung Assn. v. EPA , 985 F. 3d 914, 932 
(CADC 2021).   
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 6 WEST VIRGINIA v. EPA 
Opinion of the Court 
Although the States set the actual rules governing exist-
ing power plants, EPA itself still retains the primary regu-
latory role in Section 111(d).  The Agency, not the States, decides the amount of pollution reduction that must ulti -
mately be achieved.  It does so by again determining, aswhen setting the new source rules, “the best system of emis-
sion reduction . . . that has been adequately demonstrated 
for [existing covered] facilities.” 40 CFR §60.22(b)(5) (2021); see also 80 Fed. Reg. 64664, and n. 1. The States then sub-
mit plans containing the emissions restrictions that they
intend to adopt and enforce in order not to exceed the per-missible level of pollution established by EPA.  See §§60.23, 
60.24; 42 U. S. C. §7411(d)(1).
Reflecting the ancillary nature of Section 111(d), EPA has
used it only a handful of times since the enactment of the 
statute in 1970.  See 80 Fed. Reg. 64703, and n. 275 (past regulations pertained to “four pollutants from five source
categories”). For instance, the Agency has established 
emissions limits on acid mist from sulfuric acid production, 
41 Fed. Reg. 48706 (1976) (identifying “fiber mist elimina -
tor” technology as BSER); sulfide gases released by kraft pulp mills, 44 Fed. Reg. 29829 (1979) (determining BSER 
to be a combination of scrubbers, incineration, filtration 
systems, and temperature control); and emissions of vari-
ous harmful gases from municipal landfills, 61 Fed. Reg. 
9907 (1996) (setting BSER as use of a flare to combust the gases). It was thus only a s light overstatement for one of 
the architects of the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act to refer to Section 111(d) as an “obscure, never-used section 
of the law.” Hearings on S. 300 et al. before the Subcom-
mittee on Environmental Protection of the Senate Commit-tee on Environment and Public Works, 100th Cong., 1st 
Sess., 13 (1987) (remarks of Sen. Durenberger).

Opinion of the Court 
two rules addressing carbon dioxide pollution from power
plants—one for new plants under Section 111(b), the other
for existing plants under Section 111(d).  Both were prem-ised on the Agency’s earlier finding that carbon dioxide is
an “air pollutant” that “may reasonably be anticipated to 
endanger public health or welfare” by causing climate 
change. 80 Fed. Reg. 64530.  Carbon dioxide is not subject 
to a NAAQS and has not been listed as a toxic pollutant.
The first rule announced by EPA established federal car-
bon emissions limits for new power plants of two varieties: fossil-fuel-fired electric steam ge nerating units (mostly coal 
fired) and natural-gas-fired stationary combustion tur-
bines. Id., at 64512. Following the statutory process set
out above, the Agency determined the BSER for the two cat-egories of sources. For steam generating units, for instance,
EPA determined that the BSER was a combination of high-
efficiency production processes and carbon capture technol-
ogy. See 80 Fed. Reg. 64512.  EPA then set the emissions limit based on the amount of carbon dioxide that a plant 
would emit with these technologies in place.  Id., at 64513. 
The second rule was triggered by the first: Because EPA
was now regulating carbon dioxide from new coal and gas
plants, Section 111(d) required EPA to also address carbon
emissions from existing  coal and gas plants. See 
§7411(d)(1). It did so through what it called the Clean Power Plan rule. 
In that rule, EPA established “final emission guidelines
for states to follow in developi ng plans” to regulate existing
power plants within their borders.  Id., at 64662. To arrive 
at the guideline limits, EPA did the same thing it does when imposing federal regulations on new sources: It identified
the BSER. 
The BSER that the Agency se lected for existing coal-fired 
power plants, however, was qui te different from the BSER
it had chosen for new sources.  The BSER for existing plants 
included three types of measures, which the Agency called   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 8 WEST VIRGINIA v. EPA 
Opinion of the Court 
“building blocks.” Id., at 64667. The first building block
was “heat rate improvements” at coal-fired plants—essen-
tially practices such plants could undertake to burn coal more efficiently. Id., at 64727 .  But such improvements, 
EPA stated, would “lead to only  small emission reductions,” 
because coal-fired power plant s were already operating 
near optimum efficiency. Ibid.  On the Agency’s view, 
“much larger emission reductions [were] needed from [coal-
fired plants] to address climate change.” Ibid. 
So the Agency included two additional building blocks in
its BSER, both of which involv e what it called “generation 
shifting from higher-emitting to lower-emitting” producers 
of electricity. Id., at 64728. Building block two was a shift
in electricity production fr om existing coal-fired power
plants to natural-gas-fired plants. Ibid.  Because natural 
gas plants produce “typically less than half as much” carbondioxide per unit of electricity created as coal-fired plants, the Agency explained, “this generation shift [would] re-
duce[ ] CO
2 emissions.” Ibid.   Building block three worked 
the same way, except that the shift was from both coal- and gas-fired plants to “new low- or zero-carbon generating ca-
pacity,” mainly wind and solar.  Id., at 64729, 64748. “Most 
of the CO
2 controls” in the rule came from the application
of building blocks two and three.  Id., at 64728. 
The Agency identified three ways in which a regulated 
plant operator could implement a shift in generation to
cleaner sources. Id., at 64731. First, an operator could
simply reduce the regulated plant’s own production of elec -
tricity. Second, it could build a new natural gas plant, wind farm, or solar installation, or invest in someone else’s exist-
ing facility and then increase generation there.  Ibid.   Fi-
nally, operators could purchas e emission allowances or 
credits as part of a cap-and-trade regime.  Id. , at 64731– 
64732. Under such a scheme, sources that achieve a reduc-tion in their emissions can sell a credit representing the
value of that reduction to others, who are able to count it

Opinion of the Court 
toward their own applicable emissions caps. 
EPA explained that taking any of these steps would im-
plement a sector-wide shift in electricity production from 
coal to natural gas and renewables.  Id. , at 64731.  Given 
the integrated nature of the power grid, “adding electricityto the grid from one generator will result in the instantane-
ous reduction in generation from other generators,” and “re-
ductions in generation from one generator lead to the in-stantaneous increase in generation” by others. Id., at 
64769. So coal plants, whether by reducing their own pro-
duction, subsidizing an increase in production by cleaner 
sources, or both, would cause a shift toward wind, solar, and 
natural gas.
Having decided that the “best system of emission reduc-
tion . . . adequately demonstrated” was one that would re-duce carbon pollution mostly by moving production to
cleaner sources, EPA then se t about determining “the de-
gree of emission limitation ac hievable through the applica -
tion” of that system. 42 U. S. C. §7411(a)(1).  The Agencyrecognized that—given the nature of generation shifting—
it could choose from “a wide range of potential stringencies 
for the BSER.” 80 Fed. Reg. 64730. Put differently, in
translating the BSER into an operational emissions limit, EPA could choose whether to require anything from a little 
generation shifting to a great deal.  The Agency settled on
what it regarded as a “reasonabl e” amount of shift, which it
based on modeling of how much more electricity both natu -
ral gas and renewable sources could supply without causing undue cost increases or reducing the overall power supply. 
Id., at 64797–64811.  Based on these changes, EPA pro-
jected that by 2030, it would be feasible to have coal provide 27% of national electricity generation, down from 38% in 
2014. Id., at 64665, 64694; see Dept. of Energy, U. S. En-
ergy Information Admin., Monthly Energy Review (May2015), Electricity Net Generati on: Electric Power Sector, 
p. 106 (Table 7.2b).   
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10 WEST VIRGINIA v. EPA 
Opinion of the Court 
From these significant projected reductions in genera-
tion, EPA developed a series of  complex equations to “deter-
mine the emission performance rates” that States would be 
required to implement.  80 Fed. Reg. 64815. The calcula -
tions resulted in numerical emissions ceilings so strict that 
no existing coal plant would have been able to achieve them 
without engaging in one of the three means of shifting gen-
eration described above.  Indeed, the emissions limit the Clean Power Plan established fo r existing power plants was 
actually stricter  than the cap imposed by the simultane-
ously published standards for new plants. Compare id., at 
64742, with id., at 64513. 
The point, after all, was to compel the transfer of power
generating capacity from existing sources to wind and solar.The White House stated that the Clean Power Plan would “drive a[n] . . . aggressive transformation in the domestic 
energy industry.” White House Fact Sheet, App. in Ameri-
can Lung Assn. v. EPA , No. 19–1140 etc. (CADC), p. 2076. 
EPA’s own modeling concluded that the rule would entail billions of dollars in compliance costs (to be paid in the form of higher energy prices), require the retirement of dozens of 
coal-fired plants, and eliminate tens of thousands of jobs
across various sectors.  EPA, Regulatory Impact Analysis 
for the Clean Power Plan Final Rule 3–22, 3–30, 3–33, 6– 
24, 6–25 (2015).  The Energy Information Administrationreached similar conclusions, projecting that the rule would
cause retail electricity prices to remain persistently 10% 
higher in many States, and would reduce GDP by at least a 
trillion 2009 dollars by 2040. Dept. of Energy, Analysis of
the Impacts of the Clean Power Plan 21, 63–64 (May 2015). 
C 
These projections were never tested, because the Clean 
Power Plan never went into effe ct.  The same day that EPA 
promulgated the rule, dozens of parties (including 27States) petitioned for review in the D. C. Circuit.  After that

Opinion of the Court 
court declined to enter a stay of the rule, the challengers 
sought the same relief from th is Court.  We granted a stay,
preventing the rule from taking effect.  West Virginia  v. 
EPA , 577 U. S. 1126 (2016).  The Court of Appeals later 
heard argument on the merits en banc.  But before it could 
issue a decision, there was a change in Presidential admin-
istrations. The new administration requested that the liti-
gation be held in abeyance so that EPA could reconsider theClean Power Plan. The D. C. Circuit obliged, and later dis -
missed the petitions for review as moot. 
EPA eventually repealed the rule in 2019, concluding
that the Clean Power Plan had been “in excess of its statu-tory authority” under Section 111(d).  84 Fed. Reg. 32523 (2019). Specifically, the Agency concluded that generation
shifting should not have been considered as part of the
BSER. The Agency interpreted Section 111 as “limit[ing] 
the BSER to those systems that can be put into operation 
at a building, structure, facility, or installation,” such as
“add-on controls” and “inhere ntly lower-emitting pro-
cesses/practices/designs.”  Id. , at 32524. It then explained
that the Clean Power Plan, rather than setting the stand-
ard “based on the application of equipment and practices at 
the level of an individual facility,” had instead based it on 
“a shift in the energy generation mix at the grid level,” id., 
at 32523—not the sort of measur e that has “a potential for 
application to an individual source.” Id., at 32524. 
The Agency determined that  “the interpretative question 
raised” by the Clean Power Plan—“ i.e., whether a ‘system 
of emission reduction’ can consist of generation-shifting
measures”—fell under the “major question doctrine.” Id., 
at 32529. Under that doctrine, EPA explained, courts “ex-pect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast economic and political signifi -
cance.” Ibid. (quoting Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA , 
573 U. S. 302, 324 (2014) (internal quotation marks omit-
ted)). The Agency concluded that the Clean Power Plan was   
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12 WEST VIRGINIA v. EPA 
Opinion of the Court 
such a decision, for a number of reasons.  Its “generation-
shifting scheme was projected to have billions of dollars of 
impact.” 84 Fed. Reg. 32529.  “[N]o section 111 rule of the scores issued ha[d] ever been based on generation shifting.” 
Ibid.  And that novel reading of the statute would empower 
EPA “to order the wholesale restructuring of any industrial sector” based only on its discretionary assessment of “such
factors as ‘cost’ and ‘feasibility.’ ”  Ibid. 
EPA argued that under the major questions doctrine, a
clear statement was necessary to conclude that Congressintended to delegate authority “of this breadth to regulate
a fundamental sector of the economy.” Ibid.  It found none. 
“Indeed,” it concluded, given the text and structure of the statute, “Congress has directly spoken to this precise ques-
tion and precluded” the use of measures such as generation shifting. Ibid. 
In the same rulemaking, the Agency replaced the Clean 
Power Plan by promulgating a different Section 111(d) reg-
ulation, known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule. 
Id., at 32532.  Based on its view of what measures may per-
missibly make up the BSER, EPA determined that the best
system would be akin to building block one of the Clean 
Power Plan: a combination of equipment upgrades and op-
erating practices that would impr ove facilities’ heat rates. 
Id., at 32522, 32537. The ACE Rule determined that the 
application of its BSER measures would result in only small
reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.  Id., at 32561. 
D 
A number of States and priv ate parties immediately filed 
petitions for review in the D. C. Circuit, challenging EPA’s 
repeal of the Clean Power Plan and its enactment of the re-
placement ACE Rule.  Other States and private entities—including petitioners here We st Virginia, North Dakota,
Westmoreland Mining Holdings LLC, and The North Amer-ican Coal Corporation (NACC)—i ntervened to defend both

actions. 
The Court of Appeals consolidated all 12 petitions for re -
view into one case. It then held that EPA’s “repeal of the 
Clean Power Plan rested critically on a mistaken reading of
the Clean Air Act”—namely, that generation shifting can-
not be a “system of emission reduction” under Section 111.
985 F. 3d, at 995.  To the contrary, the court concluded, the 
statute could reasonably be re ad to encompass generation 
shifting. As part of that analysis, the Court of Appeals con -
cluded that the major questions doctrine did not apply, and thus rejected the need for a cl ear statement of congressional
intent to delegate such power to EPA. Id., at 959–968. 
Having found that EPA misund erstood the scope of its au-
thority under the Clean Air Act, the Court vacated the 
Agency’s repeal of the Cle an Power Plan and remanded to 
the Agency for further consideration.  Id., at 995.  It also 
vacated and remanded the replacement rule, the ACE Rule,
for the same reason. Ibid. 
The court’s decision, handed down on January 19, 2021,
was quickly followed by another change in Presidential ad-ministrations. One month later, EPA moved the Court of 
Appeals to partially stay the issuance of its mandate as it 
pertained to the Clean Power Plan.  The Agency did so toensure that the Clean Power Plan would not immediately 
go back into effect.  Respondent s’ Motion for a Partial Stay
of Issuance of the Mandate in American Lung Assn . v. EPA , 
No. 19–1140 etc. (CADC), p. 4.  EPA believed that such a result would not make sense while it was in the process of 
considering whether to prom ulgate a new Section 111(d) 
rule. Ibid. No party opposed the motion, and the court ac-
cordingly stayed its vacatur of the Agency’s repeal of the Clean Power Plan. 
Westmoreland, NACC, and the States defending the re-
peal of the Clean Power Plan all filed petitions for certio-
rari. We granted the petitions and consolidated the cases.595 U. S. ___ (2021).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 14 WEST VIRGINIA v. EPA 
Opinion of the Court 
II 
We first consider the Government’s contention that no pe-
titioner has Article III standing to seek our review. 
Although most disputes over standing concern whether a
plaintiff has satisfied the requirement when filing suit, “Ar-
ticle III demands that an actual controversy persist
throughout all stages of litigation.” Hollingsworth v. Perry , 
570 U. S. 693, 705 (2013) (internal quotation marks omit-
ted). The requirement of standing “must be met by persons
seeking appellate review, just as it must be met by persons 
appearing in courts of first instance.”  Arizonans for Official 
English  v. Arizona , 520 U. S. 43, 64 (1997).  In considering 
a litigant’s standing to appeal, the question is whether it 
has experienced an injury “fairly traceable to the judgment 
below. ” Food Marketing Institute  v. Argus Leader Media, 
588 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 4) (emphasis added; 
internal quotation marks omitted).  If so, and a “favorable ruling” from the appellate court “would redress [that] in -
jury,” then the appellant has a cognizable Article III stake. 
Ibid. 
Here, it is apparent that at least one group of petition-
ers—the state petitioners—are injured by the Court of Ap-
peals’ judgment. That judgment vacated “the ACE rule and 
its embedded repeal of the Clean Power Plan,” 985 F. 3d, at 
995 (emphasis added), and accordingly purports to bring
the Clean Power Plan back into legal effect. Thus, to the 
extent the Clean Power Plan harms the States, the D. C. 
Circuit’s judgment inflicts the same injury.  And there can 
be “little question” that the rule does injure the States,
since they are “the object of ” its requirement that they more
stringently regulate power pl ant emissions within their 
borders. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 504 U. S. 555, 561– 
562 (1992).
The Government counters that “agency and judicial ac-
tions” subsequent to the court’s entry of judgment have “eliminated any . . . possibility” of injury.  Brief for Federal

Opinion of the Court 
Respondents 16. First, after the decision, EPA informed 
the Court of Appeals that it does not intend to enforce the 
Clean Power Plan because it has decided to promulgate a new Section 111(d) rule.  Second, on EPA’s request, the 
lower court stayed the part of its judgment that vacated the
repeal, pending that new rulemaking.  “These circum-
stances,” says the Government, “have mooted  the prior dis-
pute as to the CPP Repeal Rule’s legality.”  Id., at 17 (em-
phasis added).
That Freudian slip, however, reveals the basic flaw in the
Government’s argument: It is the doctrine of mootness , not 
standing, that addresses whether “an intervening circum -
stance [has] deprive[d] the plaintiff of a personal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit.” Genesis HealthCare Corp.  v. 
Symczyk, 569 U. S. 66, 72 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Friends of the Earth , Inc. v. Laidlaw En -
vironmental Services (TOC) , Inc. , 528 U. S. 167, 189–192 
(2000). The distinction matters because the Government, not petitioners, bears the burden to establish that a once-
live case has become moot. Id., at 189; Adarand Construc -
tors, Inc.  v. Slater, 528 U. S. 216, 222 (2000) ( per curiam ).
That burden is “heavy” where, as here, “[t]he only con-
ceivable basis for a finding of mootness in th[e] case is [the respondent’s] voluntary conduct.” Friends of the Earth , 528 
U. S., at 189.  Although the Government briefly argues that 
the lower court’s stay of its mandate extinguished the con-troversy, it cites no authority for that proposition, and it
does not make sense: Lower courts frequently stay their 
mandates when notified that the losing party intends toseek our certiorari review.  So the Government’s mootness 
argument boils down to its representation that EPA has no 
intention of enforcing the Clean Power Plan prior to prom-
ulgating a new Section 111(d) rule.
But “voluntary cessation does not moot a case” unless it 
is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior

could not reasonably be expected to recur.” Parents In-
volved in Community Schools  v. Seattle School Dist. No. 1 , 
551 U. S. 701, 719 (2007).  Here the Government “nowhere 
suggests that if this litigation is  resolved in its favor it will
not” reimpose emissions limits predicated on generation 
shifting; indeed, it “vigorously defends” the legality of such 
an approach. Ibid. We do not dismiss a case as moot in 
such circumstances.  See City of Mesquite  v. Aladdin’s Cas-
tle, Inc. , 455 U. S. 283, 288–289 (1982).  The case thus re-
mains justiciable, and we may turn to the merits. 
III 
A 
In devising emissions limits for power plants, EPA first
“determines” the “best system of emission reduction” that—
taking into account cost, heal th, and other factors—it finds
“has been adequately demonstrated.” 42 U. S. C. §7411(a)(1). The Agency then quantifies “the degree of emission limitation achievable” if that best system were ap-
plied to the covered source. Ibid. ;  s e e  a l s o  8 0  F e d .  R e g . 
64719. The BSER, therefore, “is the central determination 
that the EPA must make in formulating [its emission]
guidelines” under Section 111.  Id., at 64723. The issue 
here is whether restructuring the Nation’s overall mix of 
electricity generation, to transition from 38% coal to 27%coal by 2030, can be the “best system of emission reduction” 
within the meaning of Section 111. 
“It is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that
the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.” 
Davis  v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury , 489 U. S. 803, 809 
(1989). Where the statute at issue is one that confers au-
thority upon an administrative agency, that inquiry must be “shaped, at least in some measure, by the nature of the
question presented”—whether Congress in fact meant to 
confer the power the agency has asserted. FDA  v. Brown &

Opinion of the Court 
Williamson Tobacco Corp. , 529 U. S. 120, 159 (2000). In the 
ordinary case, that context has no great effect on the appro-
priate analysis. Nonetheless, our precedent teaches thatthere are “extraordinary cases” that call for a different ap -
proach—cases in which the “history and the breadth of theauthority that [the agency] has asserted,” and the “eco-
nomic and political significance”  of that assertion, provide 
a “reason to hesitate before  concluding that Congress” 
meant to confer such authority. Id., at 159–160. 
Such cases have arisen from all corners of the adminis-
trative state.  In Brown & Williamson , for instance, the 
Food and Drug Administration claimed that its authority 
over “drugs” and “devices” included the power to regulate,
and even ban, tobacco products.  Id., at 126–127. We re-
jected that “expansive construction of the statute,” conclud-
ing that “Congress could not have intended to delegate”
such a sweeping and consequential authority “in so cryptica fashion.” Id., at 160. In Alabama Assn. of Realtors v. De-
partment of Health and Human Servs., 594 U. S. ___, ___ (2021) (per curiam ) (slip op., at 3), we concluded that the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention could not, un-der its authority to adopt measures “necessary to preventthe . . . spread of ” disease, institute a nationwide eviction 
moratorium in response to the COVID–19 pandemic.  We found the statute’s language a “wafer-thin reed” on which 
to rest such a measure, given “the sheer scope of the CDC’sclaimed authority,” its “unprece dented” nature, and the fact 
that Congress had failed to extend the moratorium after
previously having done so. Id., at ___–___ (slip op., at 6–8). 
Our decision in Utility Air  addressed another question re-
garding EPA’s authority—namel y, whether EPA could con-
strue the term “air pollutant,” in a specific provision of the Clean Air Act, to cover greenhous e gases.  573 U. S., at 310. 
Despite its textual plausibility, we noted that the Agency’s
interpretation would have gi ven it permitting authority

buildings, that had never before been subject to such re-
quirements. Id., at 310, 324.  We declined to uphold EPA’s 
claim of “unheralded” regulatory power over “a significant
portion of the American economy.”  Id., at 324.  In Gonzales 
v. Oregon, 546 U. S. 243 (2006), we confronted the Attorney 
General’s assertion that he co uld rescind the license of any 
physician who prescribed a controlled substance for as-sisted suicide, even in a State where such action was legal. 
The Attorney General argued that this came within his statutory power to revoke licenses where he found them “in-consistent with the public interest,” 21 U. S. C. §823(f ).  We 
considered the “idea that Congress gave [him] such broadand unusual authority through an implicit delegation . . . 
not sustainable.” 546 U. S., at 267.  Similar considerations 
informed our recent decision invalidating the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration’s mandate that “84 mil-
lion Americans . . . either obtain a COVID–19 vaccine or un-
dergo weekly medical testing at their own expense.” Na-
tional Federation of Independent Business  v. Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration , 595 U. S. ___, ___ (2022) 
(per curiam ) (slip op., at 5). We found it “telling that OSHA,
in its half century of existence,” had never relied on its au -
thority to regulate occupational hazards to impose such a
remarkable measure. Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8). 
All of these regulatory assertions had a colorable textual
basis. And yet, in each case, given the various circum-
stances, “common sense as to the manner in which Con-
gress [would have been] likely to delegate” such power to 
the agency at issue, Brown & Williamson , 529 U. S., at 133, 
made it very unlikely that Congress had actually done so.Extraordinary grants of regulatory authority are rarely ac -
complished through “modest words,” “vague terms,” or “subtle device[s].” Whitman , 531 U. S., at 468.  Nor does 
Congress typically use oblique or elliptical language to em-
power an agency to make a “radical or fundamental change”
to a statutory scheme. MCI Telecommunications Corp.  v.

Thus, in certain extraordinary cases, both separation of 
powers principles and a practical understanding of legisla-
tive intent make us “reluctant to read into ambiguous stat-
utory text” the delegation claimed to be lurking there.  Util-
ity Air , 573 U. S., at 324. To convince us otherwise, 
something more than a merely plausible textual basis for the agency action is necessary.  The agency instead must 
point to “clear congressional authorization” for the power it

The dissent criticizes us for “announc[ing] the arrival” of
this major questions doctrine, and argues that each of the decisions just cited simply followed our “ordinary method” 
of “normal statutory interpretation,” post, at 13, 15 (opinion

in this area, Brown & Williamson , post, at 15, the Court 
could not have been clearer: “In extraordinary cases . . .there may be reason to hesita te” before accepting a reading
of a statute that would, under more “ordinary” circum -
stances, be upheld.  529 U. S., at 159.  Or, as we put it more recently, we “typically greet” assertions of “extravagant
statutory power over the national economy” with “skepti-cism.” Utility Air , 573 U. S., at 324.  The dissent attempts
to fit the analysis in these cases within routine statutoryinterpretation, but the bottom line—a requirement of “clear

congressional authorization,” ibid. —confirms that the ap-
proach under the major questions doctrine is distinct.    
As for the major questions doctrine “label[ ],” post, at 13, 
it took hold because it refers  to an identifiable body of law 
that has developed over a series of significant cases all ad-
dressing a particular and recurring problem: agencies as-
serting highly consequential power beyond what Congress 
could reasonably be understood to have granted.  Scholars 
and jurists have recognized the common threads between 
those decisions.  So have we.  See Utility Air , 573 U. S., at 
324 (citing Brown & Williamson  and MCI); King  v. Burwell , 
576 U. S. 473, 486 (2015) (citing Utility Air , Brown & Wil-
liamson , and Gonzales). 
B 
Under our precedents, this is a major questions case. In 
arguing that Section 111(d) empowers it to substantially re-
structure the American energy market, EPA “claim[ed] todiscover in a long-extant statute an unheralded power” rep-
resenting a “transformative expansion in [its] regulatory
authority.” Utility Air , 573 U. S., at 324.  It located that 
newfound power in the vague language of an “ancillary pro-vision[ ]” of the Act, Whitman , 531 U. S., at 468, one that 
was designed to function as a gap filler and had rarely been used in the preceding decades.  And the Agency’s discovery allowed it to adopt a regulatory program that Congress had
conspicuously and repeatedly declined to enact itself. 
Brown & Williamson , 529 U. S., at 159–160; Gonzales, 546 
U. S., at 267–268; Alabama Assn. , 594 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip 
op., at 2, 8). Given these circumstances, there is every rea-son to “hesitate before concluding that Congress” meant to 
confer on EPA the authority it claims under Section 111(d). 
Brown & Williamson , 529 U. S., at 159–160. 
Prior to 2015, EPA had always set emissions limits under
Section 111 based on the application of measures that 
would reduce pollution by caus ing the regulated source to

operate more cleanly. See, e.g., 41 Fed. Reg. 48706 (requir-
ing “degree of control achievable through the application of
fiber mist eliminators”); see also supra , at 6. It had never 
devised a cap by looking to a “system” that would reduce
pollution simply by “shifting” polluting activity “from dirt -
ier to cleaner sources.” 80 Fed. Reg. 64726; see id., at 64738 
(“[O]ur traditional interpretation . . . has allowed regulated entities to produce as much of a particular good as they de-
sire provided that they do so through an appropriately clean (or low-emitting) process.”).  And as Justice Frankfurter has noted, “just as established practice may shed light on 
the extent of power conveyed by general statutory lan -
guage, so the want of assertion of power by those who pre-sumably would be alert to exerci se it, is equally significant 
in determining whether such  power was actually con-
ferred.” FTC v. Bunte Brothers , Inc. , 312 U. S. 349, 352 
(1941).
The Government quibbles with this description of the his-
tory of Section 111(d), pointing to one rule that it says relied 
upon a cap-and-trade mechanism to reduce emissions. See 70 Fed. Reg. 28616 (2005) (Mercury Rule).  The legality of 
that choice was controversial at the time and was never ad-
dressed by a court. See New Jersey  v. EPA , 517 F. 3d 574 
(CADC 2008) (vacating on other grounds).  Even assumingthe Rule was valid, though, it still does not help the Gov-ernment. In that regulation, EPA set the actual “emission 
cap”— i.e., the limit on emissions that sources would be re-
quired to meet—“based on the level of [mercury] emissions reductions that w[ould] be achievable by” the use of “tech-
nologies [that could be] installed and operational on a na -
tionwide basis” in the relevant timeframe—namely, wetscrubbers. 70 Fed. Reg. 28620–28621. In other words, EPA set the cap based on the application of particular controls, 
and regulated sources could have complied by installing 
them. By contrast, and by design, there is no control a coal

plant operator can deploy to attain the emissions limits es -
tablished by the Clean Power Plan.  See supra, at 10. The 
Mercury Rule, therefore, is no precedent for the Clean 
Power Plan. To the contrary, it was one more entry in an
unbroken list of prior Section 111 rules that devised the en-
forceable emissions limit by determining the best control
mechanisms available for the source.1 
This consistent understanding of “system[s] of emission 
reduction” tracked the seemingly universal view, as stated by EPA in its inaugural Section 111(d) rulemaking, that 
“Congress intended a technology-based approach” to regu-
lation in that Section.  40 Fed. Reg. 53343 (1975); see id., at 
53341 (“degree of control to be reflected in EPA’s emission 
guidelines” will be based on “application of best adequately 
demonstrated control technology”).

1The dissent cites other ostensible precedents, see post, at 25–26, but 
they are also inapposite.  A few allowed cap-and-trade or similar averag -
ing measures as compliance mechan isms, like the Mercury Rule.  See, 
e.g., 60 Fed. Reg. 65402 (1995).  The others were not Section 111 rules. 
2See McGarity 165 (EPA promulgates “technology-based new source
performance standards that require the implementation of the ‘best

L. Rev 83, 84, n. 4 (“Technology-based standards made their initial ap-
pearance” in “Section 111 of the Clean Air Act,” which “requires the EPAto set technology-based emission limitations”).   
The dissent points to a 1977 amendment to Section 111 as evidence 
that the 1970 Congress did not intend for EPA to establish this sort of
source-specific standard.  Post, at 10–11.  But it is clear that the 1977 
amendment was merely intended to pr ohibit power plants from adopting 
one specific kind of at-the-source measure—a switch from burning high-
sulfur coal to low-sulfur coal—and was not intended or understood to 
change the basic, source-focused regulatory approach.  See Wisconsin 
Elec. Power Co.  v. Reilly, 893 F. 2d 901, 919 (CA8 1990) (explaining the

referred to” the “level of con trol” required as a “best demon-
strated technology (BDT)” st andard, 73 Fed. Reg. 34073, 
and consistently applied it as such. E.g., 61 Fed. Reg. 9907
(declaring “BDT” to be “a well-designed and well-operated gas collection system and . . . a control device capable of re-
ducing [harmful gases] in the collected gas by 98 weight-percent.”).
Indeed, EPA nodded to this history in the Clean Power 
Plan itself, describing the sort of “systems of emission re-duction” it had always before selected—“efficiency improve-
ments, fuel-switching,” and “add-on controls”—as “more 
traditional air pollution contro l measures.”  80 Fed. Reg.
64784. The Agency noted that it had “considered” such 
measures as potential systems of emission reduction for 
carbon dioxide, ibid., including a measure it ultimately 
adopted as a “component” of the BSER, namely, heat rate
improvements. Id., at 64727. 
But, the Agency explained, in order to “control[ ] CO
2 from 
affected [plants] at levels . . . necessary to mitigate the dan-
gers presented by climate change,” it could not base the emissions limit on “measures that improve efficiency at the
power plants.” Id., at 64728.  “The quantity of emissions 
reductions resulting from the application of these measures” would have been “too small.”  Id., at 64727.  In-
stead, to attain the necessary “critical CO
2 reductions,” 
EPA adopted what it called a “broader, forward-thinkingapproach to the design” of Section 111 regulations.  Id., at 
64703. Rather than focus on improving the performance ofindividual sources, it would “improve the overall power sys -
tem by lowering the carbon intensity of power generation.” 
Ibid. (emphasis added).  And it would do that by forcing a
shift throughout the power grid from one type of energy 
source to another. In the words of the then-EPA Adminis-
trator, the rule was “not about pollution control” so muchas it was “an investment opportunity” for States, especially
“investments in renewables and clean energy.” Oversight

Hearing on EPA’s Proposed Carbon Pollution Standards for 
Existing Power Plants before the Senate Committee on En-

This view of EPA’s authority was not only unprecedented;
it also effected a “fundamental revision of the statute, 
changing it from [one sort of] scheme of . . . regulation” into
an entirely different kind.  MCI, 512 U. S., at 231.  Under 
the Agency’s prior view of Section 111, its role was limited
to ensuring the efficient pollution performance of each indi -
vidual regulated source. Unde r that paradigm, if a source
was already operating at that level, there was nothing more 
for EPA to do.  Under its ne wly “discover[ed]” authority, 
Utility Air , 573 U. S., at 324, however, EPA can demand 
much greater reductions in emissions based on a very dif-ferent kind of policy judgment: t hat it would be “best” if coal 
made up a much smaller share of national electricity gen -
eration. And on this view of EPA’s authority, it could go further, perhaps forcing coal pl ants to “shift” away virtually
all of their generation—i.e. , to cease making power alto -
gether.

this “unprecedented power over American industry.” In-

for example, simply requiring coal plants to become natural gas plants, 
and that this would fit within the prior regulatory approach of efficiency-improving, at-the-source measures.  Post , at 24. Of course, EPA has 
never ordered anything remotely like that, and we doubt it could.  Sec -
tion 111(d) empowers EPA to guide States in “establish[ing] standardsof performance” for “existing source[s],” §7411(d)(1), not to direct existing
sources to effectively cease to exist.

tory factors of “cost,” “nonair quality health and environ-
mental impact,” and “energy requirements.” 42 U. S. C. 
§7411(a)(1). EPA therefore must limit the magnitude ofgeneration shift it demands to a level that will not be “exor-
bitantly costly” or “threaten the reliability of the grid.”
Brief for Federal Respondents 42.
But this argument does not so much limit  the breadth of 
the Government’s claimed authority as reveal it. On EPA’s 
view of Section 111(d), Congress implicitly tasked it, and it 
alone, with balancing the many vital considerations of na -
tional policy implicated in deciding how Americans will get their energy. EPA decides, for instance, how much of a 
switch from coal to natural gas is practically feasible by2020, 2025, and 2030 before the grid collapses, and how 
high energy prices can go as a result before they become 
unreasonably “exorbitant.” 
There is little reason to think Congress assigned such de-
cisions to the Agency. For one thing, as EPA itself admittedwhen requesting special funding, “Understand[ing] and
project[ing] system-wide . . . trends in areas such as elec-
tricity transmission, distribution, and storage” requires “technical and policy expertise not traditionally needed in 
EPA regulatory development.”  EPA, Fiscal Year 2016: Jus-
tification of Appropriation Estimates for the Committee onAppropriations 213 (2015) (emphasis added).  “When [an]
agency has no comparative expertise” in making certain 
policy judgments, we have said, “Congress presumably 
would not” task it with doing so.  Kisor  v. Wilkie , 588 U. S. 
___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 17); see also Gonzales, 546 U. S., 
at 266–267. 
We also find it “highly unlikely that Congress would
leave” to “agency discretion” th e decision of how much coal- 
based generation there should be over the coming decades. 
MCI, 512 U. S., at 231; see also Brown & Williamson, 529

where else in the Clean Air Act.  The last place one would
expect to find it is in the prev iously little-used backwater of 
Section 111(d).
The dissent contends that there is nothing surprising
about EPA dictating the optimal mix of energy sources na-tionwide, since that sort of mandate will reduce air pollu -
tion from power plants, which is EPA’s bread and butter. 
Post, at 20–22.  But that does not follow.  Forbidding evic-
tions may slow the spread of disease, but the CDC’s order-ing such a measure certainly “raise[s] an eyebrow.”  Post, at 
18. We would not expect the Department of Homeland Se-
curity to make trade or foreig n policy even though doing so
could decrease illegal immigration.  And no one would con-
sider generation shifting a “tool” in OSHA’s “toolbox,” post, 
at 21, even though reducing generation at coal plants would reduce workplace illness and injury from coal dust.
The dissent also cites our decision in American Elec. 
Power Co.  v. Connecticut , 564 U. S. 410 (2011).  Post , at 20. 
The question there, however, was whether Congress wanted district court judges to decide, under unwritten fed-
eral nuisance law, “whether and how to regulate carbon- 
dioxide emissions from powerplants.” 564 U. S., at 426. We 
answered no, given the existence of Section 111(d).  But we 
said nothing about the ways in which Congress intended 
EPA to exercise its power under that provision.  And it is doubtful we had in mind that it would claim the authority

to require a large shift from coal to natural gas, wind, and 
solar.  After all, EPA had never regulated in that manner,
despite having issued many prior rules governing power plants under Section 111. See, e.g., 71 Fed. Reg. 9866 
(2006); 70 Fed. Reg. 28616; 44 Fed. Reg. 33580; 36 Fed. Reg.24875 (1973).

Finally, we cannot ignore that the regulatory writ EPA
newly uncovered conveniently en abled it to enact a program
that, long after the dangers posed by greenhouse gas emis-
sions “had become well known, Congress considered and re-
jected” multiple times.  Brown & Williamson , 529 U. S., at 
144; see also Alabama Assn. , 594 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 
2); Bunte Brothers , 312 U. S., at 352 (lack of authority not 
previously exercised “reinforce d by [agency’s] unsuccessful 
attempt . . . to secure from Congress an express grant of [the challenged] authority”).  At bottom, the Clean Power 
Plan essentially adopted a cap-and-trade scheme, or set of 
state cap-and-trade schemes, for carbon.  See 80 Fed. Reg.
64734 (“Emissions trading is . . . an integral part of our
BSER analysis.”).  Congress, however, has consistently re-jected proposals to amend the Clean Air Act to create such 
a program. See, e.g., American Clean Energy and Security 
—————— 
4 According to the dissent, “EPA is always controlling the mix of energy 
sources” under Section 111 because all of the Agency’s rules impose some 
costs on regulated plants, and ther efore (all else equal) cause those 
plants to lose some share of the electricity market.  Post, at 22. But there 
is an obvious difference between (1) i ssuing a rule that may end up caus-
ing an incidental loss of coal’s market share, and (2) simply announcing
what the market share of coal, natura l gas, wind, and solar must be, and 
then requiring plants to reduce oper ations or subsidize their competitors 
to get there. No one has ever th ought that the Clea n Power Plan was 
just business as usual.  See American Lung Assn.  v. EPA , 985 F. 3d 914, 
1000 (CADC 2021) (Walker, J., dissenting) (“Leaders of the environmen -
tal movement considered the rule ‘groundbreaking,’ called its announce -
ment ‘historic,’ and labeled it a ‘critically important catalyst.’ ” (footnotes
omitted)).

Opinion of the Court 
Act of 2009, H. R. 2454, 111th Cong., 1st Sess.; Clean En-
ergy Jobs and American Power Act, S. 1733, 111th Cong.,
1st Sess. (2009).  It has also declined to enact similar measures, such as a carbon tax.  See, e.g., Climate Protec-
tion Act of 2013, S. 332, 113th Cong., 1st Sess.; Save our Climate Act of 2011, H. R. 3242, 112th Cong., 1st Sess. 
“The importance of the issue,” along with the fact that the 
same basic scheme EPA adopted “has been the subject of anearnest and profound debate across the country, . . . makes
the oblique form of the claime d delegation all the more sus-
pect.” Gonzales, 546 U. S., at 267–268 (internal quotation 
marks omitted). 
C 
Given these circumstances, our precedent counsels skep-
ticism toward EPA’s claim that Section 111 empowers it to 
devise carbon emissions caps based on a generation shifting 
approach. To overcome that skepticism, the Government
must—under the major questions doctrine—point to “clearcongressional authorization” to regulate in that manner. 
Utility Air , 573 U. S., at 324. 
All the Government can offer, however, is the Agency’s
authority to establish emission s caps at a level reflecting 
“the application of the best system of emission reduction . . . 
adequately demonstrated.” 42 U. S. C. §7411(a)(1).  As a 
matter of “definitional possibilities,” FCC v. AT&T Inc. , 562 
U. S. 397, 407 (2011), generation shifting can be described 
as a “system”—“an aggregation or assemblage of objects
united by some form of regular interaction,” Brief for Fed-
eral Respondents 31—capable of reducing emissions.  But 
of course almost anything coul d constitute such a “system”; 
shorn of all context, the word is an empty vessel.  Such a 
vague statutory grant is not close to the sort of clear author-
ization required by our precedents. 
The Government, echoed by the other respondents, looks 
to other provisions of the Clean Air Act for support. It    
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 29 Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 
Opinion of the Court 
points out that the Act elsewhere uses the word “system” or 
“similar words” to describe ca p-and-trade schemes or other 
sector-wide mechanisms for reducing pollution.  Ibid. The 
Acid Rain program set out in Title IV of the Act establishes a cap-and-trade scheme for reducing sulfur dioxide emis -
sions, which the statute refers to as an “emission allocation and transfer system .” §7651(b) (emphasis added).  And Sec-
tion 110 of the NAAQS program specifies that “marketable
permits” and “auctions of emissions rights” qualify as “con-
trol measures, means, or techniques” that States may adopt 
in their state implementation plans in order “to meet the
applicable requirements of ” a NAAQS.  §7410(a)(2)(A). If 
the word “system” or similar words like “technique” or
“means” can encompass cap-and-trade, the Government 
maintains, why not in Section 111? 
But just because a cap-and-trade “system” can be used to
reduce emissions does not mean that it is the kind of “sys-
tem of emission reduction” referred to in Section 111.  In -
deed, the Government’s examples demonstrate why it is 
not. 
First, unlike Section 111, the Acid Rain and NAAQS pro-
grams contemplate trading systems as a means of comply-
ing with an already established emissions limit , set either 
directly by Congress (as with Acid Rain, see 42 U. S. C. §7651c) or by reference to the safe concentration of the pol-lutant in the ambient air (as with the NAAQS).  In Section 
111, by contrast, it is EPA’s job to come up with the cap 
itself: the “numerical limit on emissions” that States must 
apply to each source.  80 Fed. Reg. 64768. We doubt that 
Congress directed the Agency to set an emissions cap at the level “which reflects the degree of emission limitation 
achievable through the application of [a cap-and-trade] sys-
tem,” §7411(a)(1), for that degree is indeterminate.  It is one 
thing for Congress to authorize regulated sources to use 
trading to comply with a preset cap, or a cap that must bebased on some scientific, obje ctive criterion, such as the   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 30 WEST VIRGINIA v. EPA 
Opinion of the Court 
NAAQS. It is quite another to simply authorize EPA to set 
the cap itself wherever the Agency sees fit.
Second, Congress added the above authorizations for the 
use of emissions trading programs in 1990, simultaneous with amending Section 111 to its present form. At the time, 
cap-and-trade was a novel and highly touted concept.  The 
Acid Rain program was “the nation’s first-ever emissions 
trading program.” L. Heinzerling & R. Steinzor, A Perfect 
Storm: Mercury and the Bush Administration, 34 Env.
L. Rep. 10297, 10309 (2004). And Congress went out of its
way to amend the NAAQS statute to make absolutely clear 
that the “measures, means, [and] techniques” States could 
use to meet the NAAQS included cap-and-trade.
§7410(a)(2)(A). Yet “not a peep was heard from Congress 
about the possibility that a trading regime could be in-
stalled under §111.” Id., at 10309. 
Finally, the Government notes that other parts of the
Clean Air Act, past and present, have “explicitly limited thepermissible components of a particular ‘system’ ” of emis-
sion reduction in some regard.  Brief for Federal Respond-ents 32. For instance, a separa te section of the statute em -
powers EPA to require the “degree of reduction achievable through the retrofit  application of the best system of contin -
uous  emission reduction.” §7651f(b)(2) (emphasis added).
The comparatively unadorned use of the phrase “best sys-tem of emission reduction” in Section 111, the Government 
urges, “suggest[s] a conscious congressional” choice not  to 
limit the measures that may constitute the BSER to those applicable at or to an individual source. Id., at 32. 
These arguments, however, concern an interpretive ques-
tion that is not at issue.  We have no occasion to decide whether the statutory phrase “system of emission reduc-
tion” refers exclusively  to measures that improve the pollu-
tion performance of individual sources, such that all other actions are ineligible to qualify as the BSER.  To be sure, it is pertinent to our analysis that EPA has acted consistent

Opinion of the Court 
with such a limitation for the first four decades of the stat-
ute’s existence. But the only interpretive question before 
us, and the only one we answer, is more narrow: whetherthe “best system of emission reduction” identified by EPA
in the Clean Power Plan was within the authority granted
to the Agency in Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act.  For 
the reasons given, the answer is no.
5 
* * * 
Capping carbon dioxide emissions at a level that will 
force a nationwide transition away from the use of coal to 
generate electricity may be a se nsible “solution to the crisis
of the day.” New York  v. United States , 505 U. S. 144, 187 
(1992). But it is not plausible that Congress gave EPA the authority to adopt on its own such a regulatory scheme in 
Section 111(d). A decision of such magnitude and conse-
quence rests with Congress itself, or an agency acting pur-
suant to a clear delegation from that representative body.
The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District of Co-lumbia Circuit is reversed, and the cases are remanded for 
further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 
It is so ordered.

dicta—on “how far [our] opinion constrain[s] EPA,” post, at 12.

[June 30, 2022] 
JUSTICE GORSUCH , with whom J USTICE ALITO joins, con-
curring. 
To resolve today’s case th e Court invokes the major ques -
tions doctrine. Under that doctri ne’s terms, administrative 
agencies must be able to point to “ ‘clear congressional au-
thorization’ ” when they claim the power to make decisions 
of vast “ ‘economic and political significance.’ ”  Ante , at 17,

guarantees. I join the Court’s opinion and write to offer 
some additional observations about the doctrine on which it 
rests. 
I 
A 
One of the Judiciary’s most solemn duties is to ensure 
that acts of Congress are applied in accordance with the
Constitution in the cases that come before us. To help fulfill that duty, courts have developed certain “clear-statement”
rules.  These rules assume that, absent a clear statement 
otherwise, Congress means for its laws to operate in con-gruence with the Constitution rather than test its bounds.
In this way, these clear-statement rules help courts “act as
faithful agents of the Constitution.”  A. Barrett, Substan-
tive Canons and Faithful Agency, 90 B. U. L. Rev. 109, 169
(2010) (Barrett).
Consider some examples. The Constitution prohibits
Congress from passing laws imposing various types of ret-roactive liability. See Art. I, § 9; Landgraf v. USI Film 
Products , 511 U. S. 244, 265–266 (1994).  Consistent with 
this rule, Chief Justice Marshall long ago advised that “a 
court . . . ought to struggle hard against a [statutory] con-
struction which will, by a retrospective operation, affect the rights of parties.” United States v. Schooner Peggy, 
1 Cranch 103, 110 (1801).  Justice Paterson likewise in-sisted that courts must interpret statutes to apply only pro-
spectively “unless they are so clear, strong, and imperative,
that no other meaning can be annexed to them.”  United 
States v. Heth , 3 Cranch 399, 413 (1806).
The Constitution also incorporates the doctrine of sover-
eign immunity. See, e.g., Hans v. Louisiana , 134 U. S. 1, 
12–17 (1890). To enforce that doctrine, courts have consist-
ently held that “nothing but express words, or an insur-
mountable implication” would justify the conclusion that

lawmakers intended to abrogat e the States’ sovereign im-
munity. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 450 (1793) (Ire-
dell, J., dissenting); see Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida , 
517 U. S. 44, 55 (1996). In a similar vein, Justice Story ob-
served that “[i]t is a general rule in the interpretation of legislative acts not to construe them to embrace the sover-
eign power or government, unless expressly named or in-
cluded by necessary implication.”  United States v. Greene , 
26 F. Cas. 33, 34 (No. 15, 258) (CC Me. 1827).
The major questions doctrine works in much the same 
way to protect the Constitution’s separation of powers. 
Ante , at 19. In Article I, “the People” vested “[a]ll” federal 
“legislative powers . . . in Congress.” Preamble; Art. I, § 1. As Chief Justice Marshall put it, this means that “im-
portant subjects . . . must be entirely regulated by the leg-islature itself,” even if Congress may leave the Executive 
“to act under such general provisions to fill up the details.” 
Wayman v. Southard , 10 Wheat. 1, 42–43 (1825).  Doubt-
less, what qualifies as an important subject and what con-stitutes a detail may be debated.  See, e.g., Gundy v. United 
States, 588 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2019) (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 4–6); id., at ___–___ (G
ORSUCH , J., dissenting) (slip
op., at 10–12). But no less than its rules against retroactive legislation or protecting sove reign immunity, the Constitu-
tion’s rule vesting federal legislative power in Congress is
“vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of gov-
ernment ordained by the Constitution.”  Marshall Field & 
Co. v. Clark , 143 U. S. 649, 692 (1892).
It is vital because the framers believed that a republic—
a thing of the people—would be more likely to enact just 
laws than a regime administered by a ruling class of largely
unaccountable “ministers.”  The Federalist No. 11, p. 85 (C.
Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).  From time to time, some

GORSUCH , J., concurring 
have questioned that assessment.1 But by vesting the law-
making power in the people’s elected representatives, the 
Constitution sought to ensure “not only that all power [w]ould be derived from the people,” but also “that those 
[e]ntrusted with it should be kept in dependence on the peo-
ple.” Id., No. 37, at 227 (J. Madison).  The Constitution, too, 
placed its trust not in the hands of “a few, but [in] a number of hands,” ibid., so that those who make our laws would bet-
ter reflect the diversity of the people they represent and
have an “immediate dependence on, and an intimate sym-
pathy with, the people.”  Id., No. 52, at 327 (J. Madison).
Today, some might describe the Constitution as having de -
signed the federal lawmaking process to capture the wis-
dom of the masses. See P. Hamburger, Is Administrative
Law Unlawful? 502–503 (2014).
Admittedly, lawmaking under our Constitution can be 
difficult. But that is nothing particular to our time nor any 
accident. The framers believed that the power to make new 
laws regulating private conduct was a grave one that could,
if not properly checked, pose a serious threat to individual liberty. See The Federalist No. 48, at 309–312 (J. Madison); 
see also id., No. 73, at 441–442 (A. Hamilton). As a result,

1For example, Woodrow Wilson famous ly argued that “popular sover -
eignty” “embarrasse[d]” the Nation because it made it harder to achieve 
“executive expertness.”  The Study of Administration, 2 Pol. Sci. Q. 197,
207 (1887) (Administration).  In Wilson’s eyes, the mass of the people
were “selfish, ignorant, timid, stubborn, or foolish.”  Id., at 208.  He ex -
pressed even greater disdain for pa rticular groups, defending “[t]he 
white men of the South” for “rid[ding]  themselves, by fair means or foul, 
of the intolerable burden of governme nts sustained by the votes of igno -
rant [African-Americans].” 9 W. Wils on, History of the American People 
58 (1918).  He likewise denounced immigrants “from the south of Italy and men of the meaner sort out of  Hungary and Poland,” who possessed 
“neither skill nor energy nor any init iative of quick intelligence.”  5 id.,

the framers deliberately sought to make lawmaking diffi-
cult by insisting that two houses of Congress must agree to
any new law and the President must concur or a legislative supermajority must override his veto.
The difficulty of the design sought to serve other ends too.
By effectively requiring a br oad consensus to pass legisla -
tion, the Constitution sought to ensure that any new lawswould enjoy wide social acceptance, profit from input by anarray of different perspectives during their consideration, 
and thanks to all this prov e stable over time.  See id., No. 
10, at 82–84 (J. Madison).  The need for compromise inher-ent in this design also sought to protect minorities by en-
suring that their votes would often decide the fate of pro-posed legislation—allowing them to wield real power 
alongside the majority.  See id., No. 51, at 322–324 (J. Mad-
ison). The difficulty of legislating at the federal level aimed 
as well to preserve room for lawmaking “by governments
more local and more accountable than a distant federal” au-thority,  National Federation of Independent Business v. 
Sebelius , 567 U. S. 519, 536 (2012) (plurality opinion), and
in this way allow States to serve as “laborator[ies]” for
“novel social and economic experiments,” New State Ice Co . 
v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dis-
senting); see J. Sutton, 51 Imperfect Solutions: States and 
the Making of American Constitutional Law 11 (2018).
Permitting Congress to divest  its legislative power to the 
Executive Branch would “dash [this] whole scheme.”  De-
partment of Transportation  v. Association of American Rail -
roads , 575 U. S. 43, 61 (2015) (A

islation would risk becoming nothing more than the will of 
the current President, or, worse yet, the will of unelectedofficials barely responsive to him. See S. Breyer, Making 
Our Democracy Work: A Judge’s View 110 (2010) (“[T]he 
president may not have the ti me or willingness to review
[agency] decisions”).  In a world like that, agencies could

liberty would not be difficult and rare, but easy and profuse.
See The Federalist No. 47, at 303 (J. Madison); id., No. 62, 
at 378 (J. Madison).  Stability would be lost, with vast num-
bers of laws changing with every new presidential admin-
istration. Rather than embody a wide social consensus and 
input from minority voices, la ws would more often bear the 
support only of the party currently in power.  Powerful spe-cial interests, which are sometimes “uniquely” able to influ -
ence the agendas of administrative agencies, would flourish
while others would be left to ever-shifting winds. T. Merrill, 
Capture Theory and the Courts: 1967–1983, 72 Chi.-Kent 
L. Rev. 1039, 1043 (1997).  Finally, little would remain to 
stop agencies from moving into areas where state authority 
has traditionally predominated. See, e.g., Solid Waste 
Agency of Northern Cook Cty.  v. Army Corps of Engineers , 
531 U. S. 159, 173–174 (2001) ( SWANC ). That would be a 
particularly ironic outcome, given that so many States haverobust nondelegation doctrines designed to ensure demo-
cratic accountability in their state lawmaking processes.
See R. May, The Nondelegation Doctrine is Alive and Wellin the States, The Reg. Rev. (Oct. 15, 2020). 
B 
Much as constitutional rules about retroactive legislation 
and sovereign immunity have their corollary clear-state-ment rules, Article I’s Vesting Clause has its own:  the ma -
jor questions doctrine. See Gundy, 588 U. S., at ___–___ 
(G
ORSUCH , J., dissenting) (slip op., at 20–21).  Some version 
of this clear-statement rule can be traced to at least 1897, when this Court confronted a case involving the Interstate 
Commerce Commission, the fede ral government’s “first
modern regulatory agency.”  S. Dudley, Milestones in the
Evolution of the Administrative State 3 (Nov. 2020). The 
ICC argued that Congress had endowed it with the power
to set carriage prices for railroads.  See  ICC v. Cincinnati, 
N. O. & T. P. R. Co. , 167 U. S. 479, 499 (1897).  The Court

deemed that claimed authority “a power of supreme deli-
cacy and importance,” given the role railroads then played
in the Nation’s life. Id., at 505. Therefore, the Court ex-
plained, a special rule applied: 
“That Congress has transferred such a power to any ad-ministrative body is not to be presumed or implied fromany doubtful and uncertain language.  The words and 
phrases efficacious to make such a delegation of power
are well understood, and have been frequently used, and if Congress had intended to grant such a power to
the [agency], it cannot be doubted that it would have 
used language open to no misconstruction , but clear 
and direct .” Ibid. (emphasis added). 
With the explosive growth of the administrative state
since 1970, the major questions doctrine soon took on spe-cial importance.
2 In 1980, this Court held it “unreasonable 
to assume” that Congress gave  an agency “unprecedented
power[s]” in the “absence of a clear [legislative] mandate.” Industrial Union Dept., AFL–CIO v. American Petroleum

years that followed, the Cou rt routinely enforced “the non-

2In the 1960s and 1970s, Congress created dozens of new federal ad-
ministrative agencies.  See W. Howe ll & D. Lewis, Agencies by Presiden-
tial Design, 64 J. of Politics 1095, 1105 (Nov. 2002).  Between 1970 and 
1990, the Code of Federal Regulations grew from about 44,000 pages to 
about 106,000.  See C. DeMuth, Can the Administrative State be 
Tamed?, 8 J. Legal Analysis 121, 126 (Feb. 2016).  Today, Congress is -
sues “roughly two hundred to four hundred laws” every year, while “fed-
eral administrative agencies adopt something on the orde r of three thou -

488 U. S. 361, 373, n. 7 (1989).  In fact, this Court applied 
the major questions doctrine in “all corners of the adminis-

The Court has applied the major questions doctrine for
the same reason it has applied other similar clear-state-ment rules—to ensure that th e government does “not inad -
vertently cross constitutional lin es.”  Barrett 175.  And the 
constitutional lines at stake here are surely no less im-
portant than those this Court has long held sufficient to jus -
tify parallel clear-statement rules. At stake is not just a
question of retroactive liability or sovereign immunity, but 
basic questions about self-government, equality, fair notice, 
—————— 
3At times, this Court applied the major questions doctrine more like 
an ambiguity canon.  See FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. , 
529 U. S. 120, 159 (2000).  Ambiguity canons merely instruct courts on 
how to “choos[e] between equally plausible interpretations of ambiguoustext,” and are thus weaker than clear-statement rules.  Barrett 109.  But 
our precedents have usually applied the doctrine as a clear-statement 
rule, and the Court today confirms that is the proper way to apply it.  See

federalism, and the separation of powers.  See Part I–A, su-
pra. The major questions doctrine  seeks to protect against
“unintentional, oblique, or otherwise unlikely” intrusions
on these interests.  NFIB v. OSHA , 595 U. S., at ___ 
(GORSUCH , J., concurring) (slip op., at 5).  The doctrine does 
so by ensuring that, when agencies seek to resolve major questions, they at least act wi th clear congressional author-
ization and do not “exploit some gap, ambiguity, or doubtfulexpression in Congress’s statutes to assume responsibilities 
far beyond” those the people’s representatives actually con-ferred on them. Ibid.   As the Court aptly summarizes it 
today, the doctrine addresses “a particular and recurring
problem: agencies asserting highly consequential power be-
yond what Congress could reasonably be understood to 
have granted.”  Ante , at 20.

A 
Turning from the doctrine’s function to its application, it 
seems to me that our cases supply a good deal of guidanceabout when an agency action involves a major question for which clear congressional authority is required. 
First , this Court has indicated that the doctrine applies 
when an agency claims the power to resolve a matter of
great “political significance,” NFIB v. OSHA , 595 U. S., at 
___ (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted), or end an “earnest and profound debate across the country,” 
Gonzales, 546 U. S., at 267–268 (internal quotation marks 
omitted); see ante, at 17.  So, for example, in Gonzales, the 
Court found that the doctrine applied when the Attorney
General issued a regulation that would have effectively
banned most forms of physician-assisted suicide even as
certain States were considerin g whether to permit the prac -
tice. 546 U. S., at 267. And in NFIB v. OSHA, the Court 
held the doctrine applied when an agency sought to man-date COVID–19 vaccines nationwide for most workers at a

GORSUCH , J., concurring 
time when Congress and state legislatures were engaged in
robust debates over vaccine mandates.  595 U. S., at ___ 
(slip op., at 5); id., at ___ (G ORSUCH , J., concurring) (slip op., 
at 3). Relatedly, this Court has found it telling when Con-
gress has “ ‘considered and rejected’ ” bills authorizing 
something akin to the agency’s proposed course of action. 
Ante , at 20, 27 (quoting Brown & Williamson , 529 U. S., at 
144). That too may be a sign that an agency is attempting
to “‘work [a]round’ ” the legislative process to resolve for it -
self a question of great political significance.  NFIB v. 
OSHA , 595 U. S., at ___ (G ORSUCH , J., concurring) (slip op., 
at 3).4 
Second, this Court has said that an agency must point to
clear congressional authorization when it seeks to regulate 
“‘a significant portion of the American economy,’ ” ante, at 
18 (quoting Utility Air , 573 U. S., at 324), or require “bil-
lions of dollars in spending” by private persons or entities, King v. Burwell, 576 U. S. 473, 485 (2015).  The Court has 
held that regulating tobacco products, eliminating rate reg-ulation in the telecommunications industry, subjecting pri-
vate homes to Clean Air Act restrictions, and suspending 
local housing laws and regulations can sometimes check 
this box.  See Brown & Williamson , 529 U. S., at 160;  MCI 
Telecommunications Corp.  v. American Telephone & Tele -
graph Co., 512 U. S. 218, 231 (1994) ( MCI); Utility Air , 573 
U. S., at 324;  Alabama Assn. of Realtors , 594 U. S., at ___ 
(slip op., at 6).

4In the dissent’s view, the Court has erred both today and in the past
by pointing to failed legislation. Post, at 27–28 (opinion of KAGAN , J.). 
But the Court has not pointed to failed legislation to resolve what a duly 
enacted statutory text means, only to help resolve the antecedent ques -
tion whether the agency’s challenged action implicates a major question. 
The dissent endorses looking to extrin sic evidence to resolve that ques -
tion too. See post, at 21–22 (discussing whether there is a “mismatch” 
between an agency’s expertise and its challenged action).

Third , this Court has said that the major questions doc-
trine may apply when an agency seeks to “intrud[e] into an 
area that is the particular domain of state law.”  Ibid. Of 
course, another longstanding clear-statement rule—thefederalism canon—also applies in these situations.  To pre -
serve the “proper balance between the States and the Fed-
eral Government” and enforce  limits on Congress’s Com-
merce Clause power, courts must “ ‘be certain of Congress’s
intent’ ” before finding that it “legislate[d] in areas tradi-
tionally regulated by the States.” Gregory v. Ashcroft , 501 
U. S. 452, 459–460 (1991).  But unsurprisingly, the major 
questions doctrine and the federalism canon often travel to -
gether. When an agency claims the power to regulate vastswaths of American life, it no t only risks intruding on Con-
gress’s power, it also risks in truding on powers reserved to 
the States. See SWANC , 531 U. S., at 162, 174. 
While this list of triggers may not be exclusive, each of
the signs the Court has found significant in the past is pre-sent here, making this a relatively easy case for the doc-
trine’s application. The EPA cl aims the power to force coal
and gas-fired power plants “to ce ase [operating] altogether.” 
Ante , at 24. Whether these plants should be allowed to op-
erate is a question on which people today may disagree, but 
it is a question everyone can ag ree is vitally important.  See 
ante, at 24–25.  Congress has debated the matter fre-
quently. Ibid. ; see generally Climate Change, The History 
of a Consensus and the Causes of Inaction, Hearing before 
the Subcommittee on Environment of the House Committee 
on Oversight and Reform, 116th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. I 
(2019). And so far it has “conspicuously and repeatedly de-
clined” to adopt legislation similar to the Clean Power Plan 
(CPP). Ante , at 20; see American Lung Assn. v. EPA , 985 
F. 3d 914, 998, n. 19 (CADC 2021) (Walker, J., concurring

 12 WEST VIRGINIA v. EPA 
GORSUCH , J., concurring 
Williamson , 529 U. S., at 144.  It seems that fact has frus-
trated the Executive Branch and led it to attempt its own
regulatory solution in the CPP.  See 985 F. 3d, at 998, n. 20 (President stating that “ ‘if Congress won’t act soon . . . I 
will’”); cf. United States Telecom Assn. v. FCC , 855 F. 3d 
381, 423–424 (CADC 2017) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from
denial of rehearing en banc) (noting a “President’s interven -
tion [may] underscor[e] the enormous significance” of a reg-
ulation).
Other suggestive factors are present too.  “The electric 
power sector is among the largest in the U. S. economy,
with links to every other sector.” N. Richardson, Keeping
Big Cases From Making Bad Law: The Resurgent “MajorQuestions” Doctrine, 49 Conn. L. Rev. 355, 388 (2016).  The 
Executive Branch has acknowledg ed that its proposed rule
would force an “aggressive transfo rmation” of the electricity
sector through “transition to ze ro-carbon renewable energy 
sources.” White House Fact Sheet, App. in American Lung 
Assn. v. EPA , No. 19–1140 (CADC), pp. 2076–2077.  The 
Executive Branch has also pred icted its rule would force 
dozens of power plants to close and eliminate thousands of jobs by 2025. See EPA, Regulatory Impact Analysis for the
Clean Power Plan Final Rule 3–27, 3–30, 3–33, 6–25 (Oct.
23, 2015). And industry analysts have estimated the CPP 
would cause consumers’ electricity  costs to rise by over $200 
billion.  See National Mining Assn., EPA’s Clean Power
Plan: An Economic Impact Analysis 2, 4 (2015).  Finally, the 
CPP unquestionably has an impact on federalism, as “the 
regulation of utilities is one of the most important of the 
functions traditionally associated with the police power ofthe States.” Arkansas Elec. Cooperative Corp.  v. Arkansas 
Pub. Serv. Comm’n, 461 U. S. 375, 377 (1983).  None of this is to say the policy the agency seeks to pursue is unwise or 
should not be pursued. It is only to say that the agency
seeks to resolve for itself the sort of question normally re-served for Congress. As a resu lt, we look for clear evidence

B 
At this point, the question becomes what qualifies as a 
clear congressional statement authorizing an agency’s ac -
tion. Courts have long experience applying clear-statement rules throughout the law, and our cases have identified sev-
eral telling clues in this context too.  
First , courts must look to the legislative provisions on
which the agency seeks to rely “ ‘with a view to their place 
in the overall statutory scheme.’ ”  Brown & Williamson , 
529 U. S., at 133.  “[O]blique or elliptical language” will not supply a clear statement. Ante , at 18; see Spector v. Nor-
wegian Cruise Line Ltd. , 545 U. S. 119, 139 (2005) (plural-
ity opinion) (cautioning against reliance on “broad or gen -
eral language”). Nor may agencies seek to hide “elephants 
in mouseholes,” Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., 
Inc., 531 U. S. 457, 468 (2001), or rely on “gap filler” provi-
sions, ante, at 20. So, for example, in MCI this Court re -
jected the Federal Communicati on Commission’s attempt 
to eliminate rate regulation for the telecommunications in-
dustry based on a “subtle” provision that empowered the 
FCC to “ ‘modify’ ” rates.  512 U. S., at 231. In Brown & 
Williamson , the Court rejected the Food and Drug Admin-
istration’s attempt to regula te cigarettes based a “cryptic”
statutory provision that granted the agency the power toregulate “drugs” and “devices.” 529 U. S., at 126, 156, 160. 
And in Gonzales, the Court doubted that Congress gave the
Attorney General “broad and unusual authority” to regu -
late drugs for physician-assisted suicide through “oblique” 
statutory language.  546 U. S., at 267.  
Second, courts may examine the age and focus of the stat-
ute the agency invokes in relation to the problem the agency 
seeks to address.  As the Court puts it today, it is unlikely   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
    
  
  
 14 WEST VIRGINIA v. EPA 
GORSUCH , J., concurring 
that Congress will make an “[e]xtraordinary gran[t] of reg-
ulatory authority” through “vague language” in “ ‘a long-ex-
tant statute.’ ” Ante , at 18–20 (quoting  Utility Air , 573 
U. S., at 324).  Recently, too, this Court found a clear state-
ment lacking when OSHA sought to impose a nationwide 
COVID–19 vaccine mandate based on a statutory provision
that was adopted 40 years before the pandemic and that fo-
cused on conditions specific to the workplace rather than aproblem faced by society at large. See NFIB v. OSHA , 595 
U. S., at ___ (G
ORSUCH , J., concurring) (slip op., at 3).  Of 
course, sometimes old statutes may be written in ways that
apply to new and previously unanticipated situations.  See 
Sedima, S. P. R. L. v. Imrex Co., 473 U. S. 479, 499 (1985).
But an agency’s attempt to deploy an old statute focused on 
one problem to solve a new and different problem may alsobe a warning sign that it is acting without clear congres-
sional authority.  See ante, at 18. 
Third , courts may examine the agency’s past interpreta-
tions of the relevant statute.  See ante, at 20–21. A “con-
temporaneous” and long-held Ex ecutive Branch interpreta-
tion of a statute is entitled to some weight as evidence of 
the statute’s original charge to an agency. United States v. 
Philbrick , 120 U. S. 52, 59 (1887). Conversely, in NFIB v. 
OSHA , the Court found it “telling that OSHA, in its half 
century of existence, ha[d] never before adopted a broad 
public health regulation” under the statute that the agency 
sought to invoke as authority  for a nationwide vaccine man-
date. 595 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8); ante, at 18; see also 
Brown & Williamson , 529 U. S., at 158–159 (noting that for 
decades the FDA had said it lacked statutory power to reg-ulate cigarettes). As the Court states today, “ ‘the want of
[an] assertion of power by those who presumably would be
alert’ ” to it is “‘significant in determining whether such 
power was actually conferred.’ ”  Ante , at 21.  When an 
agency claims to have found a previously “unheralded 
power,” its assertion generally warrants “a measure of

skepticism.” Utility Air , 573 U. S., at 324.  
Fourth , skepticism may be merited when there is a mis-
match between an agency’s challenged action and its con -
gressionally assigned mission and expertise.  Ante , at 25. 
As the Court explains, “[w]hen an agency has no compara-
tive expertise in making certa in policy judgments, . . . Con-
gress presumably would not task it with doing so.”  Ibid. 
(internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). So, for 
example, in Alabama Assn. of Realtors, this Court rejected
an attempt by a public health agency to regulate housing.594 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  And in NFIB v. OSHA , the 
Court rejected an effort by a wo rkplace safety agency to or-
dain “broad public health measures” that “f[ell] outside [its] sphere of expertise.” 595 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).
5 
Asking these questions again yields a clear answer in our 
case. See ante, at 28–31. As the Court details, the agency
before us cites no specific stat utory authority allowing it to 
transform the Nation’s ele ctrical power supply.  See ante, 
at 28. Instead, the agency relies on a rarely invoked statu-
tory provision that was passed with little debate and has
been characterized as an “obscure, never-used section of the 
law.” Ante , at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nor 
has the agency previously in terpreted the relevant provi-
sion to confer on it such vast authority; there is no original, longstanding, and consistent interpretation meriting judi -

5The dissent not only agrees that a mismatch between an agency’s ex-
pertise and its challenged action is relevant to the major questions doc -
trine analysis; the dissent suggests that such a mismatch is necessary to 
the doctrine’s application.  See post , at 14–15. But this Court has never 
taken that view.  See, e.g., ICC v. Cincinnati, N. O. & T. P. R. Co. , 167 
U. S. 479, 505 (1897) (interstate commerce agency regulating interstate
railroad commerce); Industrial Union Dept., AFL–CIO  v. American Pe-
troleum Institute , 448 U. S. 607, 645 (1980) (p lurality opinion) (workplace 
safety agency regulating workplace carcinogens); Brown & Williamson , 
529 U. S., at 159–160 (drug agency regulating tobacco); King  v. Burwell ,

match” between the EPA’s expertise over environmental
matters and the agency’s claim that “Congress implicitly tasked it, and it alone, with balancing the many vital con -
siderations of national policy implicated in deciding how Americans will get their energy.” Ante , at 25. Such a 
claimed power “requires technical and policy expertise not 
traditionally needed in [the] EPA’s regulatory develop-
ment.” Ibid.  (internal quotation marks omitted).  Again, in
observing this much, the Court does not purport to pass on 
the wisdom of the agency’s course.  It acknowledges only 
that agency officials have sought to resolve a major policy 
question without clear legislative authorization to do so.

In places, the dissent seems to suggest that we should not 
be unduly “ ‘concerned’ ” with the Constitution’s assignment
of the legislative power to Congress.  Post, at 29 (opinion of 
K
AGAN , J.).  Echoing Woodrow Wilson, the dissent seems to 
think “a modern Nation” cannot afford such sentiments. Post, at 29–31. But recently, our dissenting colleagues
acknowledged that the Constitution assigns “all legislative Powers” to Congress and “bar[s their] further delegation.” Gundy , 588 U. S., at ___ (plurality opinion of K
AGAN , J.)
(slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks and alterationomitted). To be sure, in that case we disagreed about the
exact nature of the “nondelegation inquiry” courts must em -
ploy to vindicate the Constitution.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at
5). But like Chief Justice Marshall, we all recognized that the Constitution does impose some limits on the delegation 
of legislative power.  See ibid.; Wayman , 10 Wheat., at 42– 
43. And while we all agree that administrative agencies 
have important roles to play in a modern nation, surely
none of us wishes to abandon our Republic’s promise that 
the people and their representatives should have a mean-

all power should be derived from the people; but that those
entrusted with it should be kept in dependence on the peo -

So what is our real point of disagreement?  The dissent 
next suggests that the Court strays from its commitment to
textualism by relying on a clear-statement rule (the major
questions doctrine) to re solve today’s case.  Post, at 28. But 
our law is full of clear-statement rules and has been since 
the founding. Our colleagues do not dispute the point.  In 
fact, they have regularly invoked many of these rules.7

If that’s not the problem, perhaps the dissent means to 
suggest that the major questions doctrine does not belong
on the list of our clear-statement rules. At times, the dis-sent appears to dismiss the doctrine as a “get-out-of-text
free car[d].” Ibid. The dissent even seems to suggest that
the doctrine could threaten “the safety and efficacy of med -
ications” or lead to “the routine adulteration of food.”  Post,

the major questions doctrine should “sensibl[y]” apply in at

In the end, our disagreement really seems to center on a 
difference of opinion about whether the statute at issue
here clearly authorizes the agency to adopt the CPP.  The dissent even complains that I have failed to conduct an ex-
haustive analysis of the relevant statutory language.  See 
post, at 28, n. 8. But in this concurrence, I have sought to 
provide some observations about the underlying doctrine onwhich today’s decision rests.  On the merits of the case be-fore us, I join the Court’s op inion, which comprehensively 
sets forth why Congress did no t clearly authorize the EPA
to engage in a “generation shifting approach” to the produc -
tion of energy in this country.  Ante , at 28. In reaching its
judgment, the Court hardly professes to “appoin[t] itself”“the decision-maker on climate policy.” Post, at 33. The 
Court acknowledges only that, under our Constitution, the people’s elected representatives in Congress are the deci-
sionmakers here—and they have not clearly granted the 
agency the authority it claims for itself.  Ante , at 31.

When Congress seems slow to solve problems, it may be
only natural that those in th e Executive Branch might seek 
to take matters into their own hands.  But the Constitution does not authorize agencies to use pen-and-phone regula-
tions as substitutes for laws passed by the people’s repre-
sentatives. In our Republic, “[i]t is the peculiar province ofthe legislature to prescribe general rules for the govern -
ment of society.” Fletcher v. Peck , 6 Cranch 87, 136 (1810).
Because today’s decision helps safeguard that foundational 
constitutional promise, I am pleased to concur.

Congress charged EPA with addressing those potentially 
catastrophic harms, including through regulation of fossil-fuel-fired power plants. Section 111 of the Clean Air Act 
directs EPA to regulate stationary sources of any substance
that “causes, or contributes significantly to, air pollution” and that “may reasonably be ant icipated to endanger public
health or welfare.” 42 U. S. C. §7411(b)(1)(A).  Carbon di-oxide and other greenhouse gases fit that description.  See

setts, 549 U. S., at 528–532.  EPA thus serves as the Na-
tion’s “primary regulator of greenhouse gas emissions.” 
American Elec. Power , 564 U. S., at 428.  And among the
most significant of the entities it regulates are fossil-fuel -
fired (mainly coal- and natural-g as-fired) power plants.  To -
day, those electricity-producing plants are responsible for
about one quarter of the Nation’s greenhouse gas emissions. 
See EPA, Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Apr. 14, 
2022), https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions. Curbing that output is a necessary part of 
any effective approach for addressing climate change.
To carry out its Section 111 responsibility, EPA issued 
the Clean Power Plan in 2015. The premise of the Plan—
which no one really disputes—was that operational im -
provements at the individual-plant level would either “lead
to only small emission reductions” or would cost far more 
than a readily available regulatory alternative. 80 Fed. 
Reg. 64727–64728 (2015). That alternative—which fossil-
fuel-fired plants were “already using to reduce their [carbon
dioxide] emissions” in “a cost effective manner”—is called 
generation shifting. Id., at 64728, 64769. As the Court ex-
plains, the term refers to ways of shifting electricity gener-ation from higher emitting sources to lower emitting ones—
more specifically, from coal-fired to natural-gas-fired sources, and from both to re newable sources like solar and 
wind. See ante, at 8. A power company (like the many sup-
porting EPA here) might dive rt its own resources to a 
cleaner source, or might participate in a cap-and-trade sys-tem with other companies to achieve the same emissions-reduction goals. 
This Court has obstructed EPA’s effort from the begin-
ning. Right after the Obama administration issued the 
Clean Power Plan, the Court stayed its implementation.
That action was unprecedented : Never before had the Court 
stayed a regulation then under review in the lower courts.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 4 WEST VIRGINIA v. EPA 
KAGAN , J., dissenting 
See Reply Brief for 29 States and State Agencies in No. 
15A773, p. 33 (conceding the point).  The effect of the 
Court’s order, followed by the Trump administration’s re-peal of the rule, was that the Clean Power Plan never went 
into effect. The ensuing years, though, proved the Plan’s 
moderation. Market forces alone caused the power industry
to meet the Plan’s nationwid e emissions target—through 
exactly the kinds of generation shifting the Plan contem-
plated. See 84 Fed. Reg. 32561–32562 (2019); Brief for
United States 47. So by the time yet another President took
office, the Plan had become, as a practical matter, obsolete. 
For that reason, the Biden administration announced that, 
instead of putting the Plan into effect, it would commence a 
new rulemaking. Yet this Court determined to pronounce
on the legality of the old rule anyway.  The Court may be
right that doing so does not violate Article III mootness rules (which are notoriously strict).  See ante, at 14–16. But 
the Court’s docket is discretionary, and because no one isnow subject to the Clean Power Plan’s terms, there was no
reason to reach out to decide  this case.  The Court today
issues what is really an advisory opinion on the properscope of the new rule EPA is considering. That new rule 
will be subject anyway to immediate, pre-enforcement judi-cial review.  But this Cou rt could not wait—even to see 
what the new rule says—to constrain EPA’s efforts to ad-dress climate change.
The limits the majority now puts on EPA’s authority fly
in the face of the statute Congress wrote. The majority saysit is simply “not plausible” that Congress enabled EPA to
regulate power plants’ emissi ons through generation shift-
ing. Ante , at 31. But that is just what Congress did when
it broadly authorized EPA in Section 111 to select the “best 
system of emission reduction” for power plants. §7411(a)(1). The “best system” full stop—no ifs, ands, or 
buts of any kind relevant here.  The parties do not dispute
that generation shifting is indeed the “best system”—the

most effective and efficient way to reduce power plants’ car -
bon dioxide emissions.  And no other provision in the Clean
Air Act suggests that Congress meant to foreclose EPA fromselecting that system; to the contrary, the Plan’s regulatory
approach fits hand-in-glove with the rest of the statute. 
The majority’s decision rests on one claim alone: that gen-
eration shifting is just too new and too big a deal for Con-
gress to have authorized it in Section 111’s general terms. But that is wrong. A key reason Congress makes broad del-
egations like Section 111 is so an agency can respond, ap-
propriately and commensurately, to new and big problems.Congress knows what it doesn’ t and can’t know when it 
drafts a statute; and Congress therefore gives an expert agency the power to address issues—even significant
ones—as and when they arise.  That is what Congress did 
in enacting Section 111.  The majority today overrides that legislative choice. In so doing,  it deprives EPA of the power 
needed—and the power granted—to curb the emission of greenhouse gases. 
I 
The Clean Air Act was major le gislation, designed to deal
with a major public policy issue.  As Congress explained, its
goal was to “speed up, expand, and intensify the war 
against air pollution” in all its forms.  H. R. Rep. No. 91– 
1146, p. 1 (1970).  Or as this Court similarly recognized, the
Act was a “drastic remedy to what was perceived as a seri-ous and otherwise uncheckable problem.”  Union Elec. Co. 
v. EPA , 427 U. S. 246, 256 (1976). The Act, as the majority
describes, established three major regulatory programs to
control air pollution from stationary sources like power 
plants. See ante, at 2–6.  The National Ambient Air Quality 
Standards (NAAQS) and Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) 
programs prescribe standards fo r specified pollutants, not 
including carbon dioxide. Section 111’s New Source Perfor-
mance Standards program provides an additional tool for

KAGAN , J., dissenting 
regulating emissions from categories of stationary sources 
deemed to contribute significantly to pollution.  As applied 
to existing (not new) sources, the program mandates—viaSection 111(d)—that EPA set emissions levels for pollu-
tants not covered by the NAAQS or HAP programs, includ-
ing carbon dioxide.
Section 111(d) thus ensures that EPA regulates existing 
power plants’ emissions of all pollutants.  When the pollu-
tant at issue falls within the NAAQS or HAP programs, 
EPA need do no more. But when the pollutant falls outside
those programs, Section 111(d) requires EPA to set an emis-
sions level for currently operating power plants (and other 
stationary sources). That means no pollutant from such asource can go unregulated: As the Senate Report explained, 
Section 111(d) guarantees that “there should be no gaps in 
control activities pertaining to  stationary source emissions 
that pose any significant dang er to public health or wel-
fare.” S. Rep. No. 91–1196, p. 20 (1970).  Reflecting that language, the majority calls Section 111(d) a “gap-filler.” 
Ante , at 5.  It might also be thought of as a backstop or 
catch-all provision, protecting against pollutants that the NAAQS and HAP programs let go by.  But the section is 
not, as the majority further claims, an “ancillary provision” 
or a statutory “backwater.”  Ante, at 20, 26. That charac -
terization is a non-sequitur.  That something is a backstop does not make it a backwater. Even if they are needed only 
infrequently, see ante, at 6, 20, backstops can perform a 
critical function—and this one surely does.  Again, Section
111(d) tells EPA that when a pollutant—like carbon diox-
ide—is not regulated through other programs, EPA must undertake a further regulatory  effort to control that sub-
stance’s emission from existing stationary sources.  In that 
way, Section 111(d) operates to ensure that the Act achieves
comprehensive pollution control.
Section 111 describes the pres cribed regulatory effort in
expansive terms. EPA must set for the relevant source

(here, fossil-fuel-fired power plants) and the relevant pollu-
tant (here, carbon dioxide) an emission level—more partic-
ularly, 
“the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction 
which (taking into account the cost of achieving such
reduction and any nonair quality health and environ-
mental impact and energy requirements) the [EPA] Ad-
ministrator determines has been adequately demon-strated.” §7411(a)(1). 
To take that language apart a bit, the provision instructsEPA to decide upon the “best system of emission reduction
which . . . has been adequately demonstrated.”  The provi-
sion tells EPA, in making that  determination, to take ac-
count of both costs and varied “nonair” impacts (on health, 
the environment, and the supply of energy).  And the provi-
sion finally directs EPA to set the particular emissions limit 
achievable through use of the demonstrated “best system.” 
Taken as a whole, the section provides regulatory flexibility and discretion. It imposes, to be sure, meaningful con-
straints: Take into account costs and nonair impacts, and
make sure the best system has a proven track record.
1  But 
the core command—go find the best system of emission re-
duction—gives broad authority to EPA.
If that flexibility is not apparent on the provision’s face, 
consider some dictionary defi nitions—supposedly a staple
of this Court’s supposedly textualist method of reading stat-
utes. A “system” is “a complex unity formed of many often
diverse parts subject to a common plan or serving a common
purpose.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 
2322 (1971). Or again: a “system” is “[a]n organized and

similar definition—cited to th e Solicitor General’s brief but 
originally from another dictionary—is just too darn broad. 
Ante , at 28; see Brief for United States 31 (quoting Web-
ster’s New International Dictionary 2562 (2d ed. 1959)). “[A]lmost anything” capable of reducing emissions, the ma-
jority says, “could cons titute such a ‘system’ ” of emission 
reduction. Ante , at 28.  But that is rather the point.  Con-
gress used an obviously broad word (though surrounding it 
with constraints, see supra, at 7) to give EPA lots of latitude
in deciding how to set emission s limits.  And contra the ma-
jority, a broad term is not the same thing as a “vague” one. 
Ante , at 18, 20, 28.  A broad term is comprehensive, exten -
sive, wide-ranging; a “vague” term is unclear, ambiguous,
hazy. (Once again, dictionaries would tell the tale.)  So EPA 
was quite right in stating in the Clean Power Plan that the 
“[p]lain meaning” of the term “system” in Section 111 refers
to “a set of measures that wo rk together to reduce emis-
sions.”  80 Fed. Reg. 64762.  Another of this Court’s opin-
ions, involving a matter other than the bogeyman of envi-
ronmental regulation, might have stopped there. 
For generation shifting fits comfortably within the con-
ventional meaning of a “system of emission reduction.” 
Consider one of the most common mechanisms of genera-tion shifting: the use of a cap-and-trade scheme. Here is 
how the majority describes cap and trade: “Under such a 
scheme, sources that receive a reduction in their emissions 
can sell a credit representing the value of that reduction to
others, who are able to count it toward their own applicable emissions caps.”  Ante , at 8–9. Does that sound like a “sys-
tem” to you?  It does to me too.  And it also has to this Court. In the past, we have explained that “[t]his type of ‘cap-and -
trade’ system cuts costs while still reducing pollution to tar-
get levels.” EPA  v. EME Homer City Generation, L. P. , 572 
U. S. 489, 503, n. 10 (2014) (emphasis added).  So what does

the majority mean when it says that “[a]s a matter of defi-
nitional possibilities , generation shifting can be described 
as a ‘system’ ”?  Ante , at 28 (emphasis added; citation and 
some internal quotation marks omitted). Rarely has a stat -
utory term so clearly applied. 
Other statutory provisions confirm the point. The Clean 
Air Act’s acid rain provision, for example, describes a cap-
and-trade program as an “emission allocation and transfer system .”  §7651(b) (emphasis added).  So a “system,” accord-
ing to the statute’s own usage, includes the kind of cap-and-trade mechanism that the Clean Power Plan relied on.  And 
in a somewhat different way, the NAAQS provision shows 
that Section 111 encompasses such a regulatory technique.  
Under that provision, cap-and-trade schemes qualify as
“control measures, means, or techniques” that state plans may use to reduce emissions.  §7410(a)(2)(A).  That lan -
guage, of course, does not use the word “system.”  But in specifying that cap and trade is allowable under the 
NAAQS program, the provision supports the same conclu -
sion here—because Section 111 directs EPA to use “a pro -
cedure similar to that provided by [the NAAQS].”§7411(d)(1). The majority discounts the relevance of both
those provisions on the ground that they contemplate trad-ing systems only “as a means of complying with an already 
established emissions limit .” Ante , at 29 (emphasis in orig-
inal).  That is a distinction, to be sure.  But to begin, it is 
far less of one than the majority thinks: In arguing that 
EPA’s claim of authority here would allow it to take the
emissions limit as low as it wants, the majority ignores the 
varied constraints surrounding the “best system” language. See supra, at 7. And still more important for interpretive
purposes, the distinction appears only in the majority’sopinion, not in any statutory language.  That text, to the 
contrary, says to EPA: Do as you would do under the 
NAAQS and Acid Rain programs—go ahead and use cap and trade.   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
 
 10 WEST VIRGINIA v. EPA 
KAGAN , J., dissenting 
There is also a flipside point: Congress declined to include 
in Section 111 the restrictions on EPA’s authority contained 
in other Clean Air Act provisions . Most relevant here, quite
a number of statutory sections confine EPA’s emissions-reduction efforts to technolo gical controls—essentially, 
equipment or processes that can be put into place at a par-ticular facility.  See ante, at 4 (describing those controls). 
So, for example, one provision tells EPA to set standards 
“reflect[ing] the greatest degree of emission reduction 
achievable through the application of technology.” 
§7521(a)(3)(A)(i). Others direct the use of the “best availa-
ble retrofit technology,” or the “best available control tech-
nology,” or the “maximum achievable control technology.”
§§7491(b)(2)(A), (g)(2), 7475(a)(4), 7479(3), 7412(g)(2).
There are still more.  See, e.g. , §§7411(h), 7511a(c)(7), 
7651f(b)(2). None of those provisions would allow EPA to 
set emissions limits based on generation shifting, as the
Agency acknowledges.  See Br ief for United States 32–33. 
But nothing like the language of those provisions is in -
cluded in Section 111. That matters under normal rules of statutory interpretation.  As Justice Scalia once wrote for 
the Court: “We do not lightly assume that Congress has
omitted from its adopted text requirements that it nonethe-less intends to apply, and our reluctance is even greater 
when Congress has shown elsewhere in the same statute
that it knows how to make such a requirement manifest.” 
Jama  v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement , 543 U. S. 
335, 341 (2005).
Statutory history serves only t o  p i l e  o n : I t  s h o w s  t h a t 
Congress has specifically declined to restrict EPA to 
technology-based controls in its regulation of existing sta-
tionary sources. The key moment came in 1977, when Con-
gress amended Section 111 to distinguish between newsources and existing ones. Fo r new sources, EPA could se-
lect only the “best technological  system of continuous emis -
sion reduction.” Clean Air Act Amendments, §109(c)(1)(A),

91 Stat. 700 (emphasis added).  But for existing sources, the
word “technological” was struck out: EPA could select the
“best system of continuous emission reduction.”  Ibid. The 
House Report emphasized Congress’s deliberate choice: 
Whereas the standards set for ne w sources were to be based 
on “the best technological” controls, the “standards adoptedfor existing sources” were “to  be based on available means 
of emission control (not necessa rily technological).”  H. R. 
Rep. No. 95–564, p. 129 (1977). The Report did not furtherexplain the distinction. But presumably Congress gave
EPA more flexibility over existing plants because imposing
technological controls on old facilities is often not cost- 
effective.
2 Thirteen years later, Congress followed up by de-
leting from Section 111 the technological limitation apply-
ing to new facilities. See Clean Air Act Amendments of 
1990, §403(a), 104 Stat. 2631.  Once again, then, Congress
faced a choice: confine EPA to technological controls, or not.
And replicating its earlier action for existing sources, Con-gress chose not.
The majority breezes past that congressional choice on
the ground that today’s opinion does not resolve whether 
EPA can regulate in some non-technological ways; instead,
the opinion says only that the Clean Power Plan goes too 
—————— 
2The majority offers a theory for wh y Congress insisted on a techno -
logical system for new sources: It was, the majority says, to prevent 
EPA’s use of a particular kind of technological system (involving fuel 
switching) to achieve emissions reductions. See ante, at 22, n. 2, 23. To 
begin with: I don’t see how requiring EPA to select among technological
systems precludes it from picking what  the majority agrees is one such 
measure. See ante, at 4, 22, n. 2, 22–23. But more important, I can’t see 
why the majority’s explanation matters.  Let’s assume the majority is
right about Congress’s motive. The key point remains the same: What-
ever that motive, Congress’s instruction to use technological systems ap -
plied only to new sources, and not to existing ones.  As to the latter, Con-gress allowed EPA more latitude: The Agency could use technological or 
non-technological methods, as it prefer red. That distinction is what cre-
ates interpretive difficulties for the majority—again, no matter why it arose.

far. See ante, at 30–31.  That is a puzzling point.  As an 
initial matter, it recharacterizes what this case has always
been about. The Trump administration repealed the Clean Power Plan for one central reas on: because (in its view) Sec-
tion 111 confines EPA to facility-specific, technological measures. See 84 Fed. Reg. 32523–32529. In reviewing
that repeal, the court below thus  addressed that limit alone. 
See American Lung Assn. v. EPA , 985 F. 3d 914, 944 (CADC 
2021). So add to the oddity of the Court’s declaring a de-funct regulation unlawful, see supra, at 4, the irregularity
of its suggesting some kind of non-technological limit that no one (not EPA, not the parti es, not the court below) has 
ever considered. More important here, both the nature and the statutory basis of that limit are left a mystery.  If the 
majority is not distinguishing between technological con-trols and all others, what is it doing—and how far does its
opinion constrain EPA?  The majority makes no effort to 
say. And because that is so, the majority cannot even at-
tempt to ground its limit in the statutory language.  I’ve 
just shown that restricting EPA to technological controls is 
inconsistent with Section 111, especially when read in con-
junction with other statutory provisions.  And the majority
provides no reason to think that its (possibly) different limit fares any better.  Section 111 does not impose any con-
straints—technological or otherwise—on EPA’s authorityto regulate stationary sources (except for those stated, like
cost). In somehow (and to some extent) saying otherwise, 
the majority flouts the statutory text.
“Congress,” this Court has sa id, “knows to speak in plain
terms when it wishes to circumscribe, and in capaciousterms when it wishes to enlarge, agency discretion.”  Ar-
lington  v. FCC , 569 U. S. 290, 296 (2013).  In Section 111, 
Congress spoke in capacious ter ms.  It knew that “without 
regulatory flexibility, changing circumstances and scien-tific developments would soon render the Clean Air Act ob-solete.” Massachusetts , 549 U. S., at 532.  So the provision

enables EPA to base emissions limits for existing stationary 
sources on the “best system.”  That system may be techno-
logical in nature; it may be whatever else the majority has in mind; or, most important here, it may be generation
shifting. The statute does not care.  And when Congress 
uses “expansive language” to authorize agency action,
courts generally may not “impos [e] limits on [the] agency’s 
discretion.” Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul 
Home  v. Pennsylvania , 591 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 
16). That constraint on judici al authority—that insistence 
on judicial modesty—should resolve this case. 
II 
The majority thinks not, contending that in “certain ex-
traordinary cases”—of which this is one—courts should start off with “skepticism” t hat a broad delegation author-
izes agency action. Ante, at 19. The majority labels that 
view the “major questions doctrine,” and claims to find sup-
port for it in our caselaw. Ante , at 19–20, 28. But the rele-
vant decisions do normal stat utory interpretation: In them, 
the Court simply insisted that the text of a broad delega-tion, like any other statute, should be read in context, and 
with a modicum of common sense.  Using that ordinary
method, the decisions struck down agency actions (even
though they plausibly fit within a delegation’s terms) for
two principal reasons.  First, an agency was operating faroutside its traditional lane, so that it had no viable claim of 
expertise or experience.  And se cond, the action, if allowed, 
would have conflicted with, or even wreaked havoc on, Con-gress’s broader design.  In short, the assertion of delegated 
power was a misfit for both the agency and the statutory scheme. But that is not true here.  The Clean Power Plan 
falls within EPA’s wheelhouse, and it fits perfectly—as I’ve
just shown—with all the Clean Air Act’s provisions. That 
the Plan addresses major issues of public policy does not 
upend the analysis. Congress wanted EPA to do just that.

Section 111 entrusts important matters to EPA in the ex-
pectation that the Agency will use that authority to combat 
pollution—and that courts will not interfere. 
A 
“[T]he words of a statute,” as the majority states, “must
be read in their context and with a view to their place in the
overall statutory scheme.” FDA  v. Brown & Williamson To-
bacco Corp. , 529 U. S. 120, 133 (2000); see ante, at 16. We 
do not assess the meaning of a single word, phrase, or pro-vision in isolation; we also consider the overall statutory de-
sign. And that is just as true of statutes broadly delegating
power to agencies as of any other kind.  In deciding on the
scope of such a delegation, courts must assess how an agency action claimed to fall within the provision fits with
other aspects of a statutory plan.
So too, a court “must be guided to a degree by common 
sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely to dele-
gate.” Brown & Williamson, 529 U. S., at 133.  Assume that 
a policy decision, like this one, is a matter of significant “economic and political magnitude.” Ibid. We know that 
Congress delegates such decisions to agencies all the time—
and often via broadly framed provisions like Section 111.
See infra , at 29–31.  But Congress does so in a sensible way.
To decide whether an agency action goes beyond what Con-gress wanted, courts must assess (among other potentially relevant factors) the nature of the regulation, the nature of
the agency, and the relationship of the two to each other. 
See, e.g., Barnhart  v. Walton, 535 U. S. 212, 222 (2002). In 
particular, we have understood, Congress does not usuallygrant agencies the authority to decide significant issues on 
which they have no particular expertise.  So when there is 
a mismatch between the agency’s usual portfolio and agiven assertion of power, courts have reason to question
whether Congress intended a delegation to go so far. 
The majority today goes beyond those sensible principles.

It announces the arrival of th e “major questions doctrine,” 
which replaces normal text-in- context statutory interpreta -
tion with some tougher-to-satisfy set of rules.  Ante , at 16– 
31. Apparently, there is now a two-step inquiry.  First, a 
court must decide, by looking at some panoply of factors,
whether agency action presents an “extraordinary case[ ].”  
Ante , at 17; see  ante , at 20–28. If it does, the agency “must 
point to clear congressional aut horization for the power it
claims,” someplace over and above the normal statutory ba-
sis we require. Ante , at 19 (internal quotation marks omit-
ted); see ante , at 28–31. The result is statutory interpreta -
tion of an unusual kind.  It is not until page 28 of a 31-page
opinion that the majority begins to seriously discuss the 
meaning of Section 111. And even then, it does not address 
straight-up what should be the question: Does the text of that provision, when read in context and with a common-
sense awareness of how Congre ss delegates, authorize the
agency action here? 
The majority claims it is just following precedent, but
that is not so. The Court has never even used the term “ma-
jor questions doctrine” before. And in the relevant cases, 
the Court has done statutory construction of a familiar sort.It has looked to the text of a delegation.  It has addressed 
how an agency’s view of that text works—or fails to do so—
in the context of a broader statutory scheme. And it has asked, in a common-sensical (or call it purposive) vein,
about what Congress would have made of the agency’s
view—otherwise said, whethe r Congress would naturally 
have delegated authority over some important question to 
the agency, given its expertise and experience.  In short, in assessing the scope of a delegation, the Court has consid-
ered—without multiple steps,  triggers, or special presump-
tions—the fit between the power claimed, the agency claim-ing it, and the broader statutory design. 
The key case here is FDA  v. Brown & Williamson. There, 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asserted that its   
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 16 WEST VIRGINIA v. EPA 
KAGAN , J., dissenting 
power to regulate “drugs” and “devices” extended to tobacco 
products. The claim had something to it: FDA has broad authority over “drugs” and drug-delivery “devices,” and thedefinitions of those terms could be read to encompass nico-
tine and cigarettes. But th e asserted authority “simply
[did] not fit” the overall statutor y scheme.  529 U. S., at 143. 
FDA’s governing statute required the agency to ensure that 
regulated products were “safe” to be marketed—but there was no making tobacco products safe in the usual sense. 
Id., at 133–143.  So FDA would have had to reinterpret 
what it meant to be “safe,” or else ban tobacco products al-together. Ibid.  Both options, the Court thought, were pre-
posterous. Until the agency action at issue, tobacco prod-
ucts hadn’t been spoken of in the same breath as 
pharmaceuticals (FDA’s paradigmatic regulated product).
And Congress had created in several statutes a “distinct
regulatory scheme” for toba cco, not involving FDA.  Id., at 
155–156. So all the evidence was that Congress had never meant for FDA to have any—let alone total—control over
the tobacco industry, with its “unique political history.”  Id., 
at 159. Again, there was “simply” a lack of “fit” between the
regulation at issue, the agency in question, and the broader 
statutory scheme. Id., at 143. 
The majority’s effort to find support in Brown & William-
son for its interpretive approach fails.  See ante, at 19. It 
may be helpful here to quote the full sentence that the ma-jority quotes half of. “In extraordinary cases,” the Courtstated, “there may be reason to hesitate before concluding
that Congress has intended such an implicit delegation.”
529 U. S., at 159.  For anyone familiar with this Court’s 
Chevron doctrine, that language will ring a bell.  The Court 
was saying only—and it was elsewhere explicit on this
point—that there was reason to hesitate before giving
FDA’s position Chevron deference.  See id., at 132–133, 
159–161. And what was that reason?  The Court went on to explain that it would not defer to FDA because it read

the relevant statutory provisio ns as negating the agency’s 
claimed authority. See id., at 160 (“[W]e are obliged to defer 
not to the agency’s expansive construction of the statute,
but to Congress’ consistent judgment to deny the FDA this
power”); id., at 133 (finding at Chevron ’s first step that
“Congress has directly spoken to the issue here and pre-cluded the FDA’s” asserted power).  In reaching that con-
clusion, the Court relied (as I’ve  just explained) not on any 
special “clear authorization” demand, but on normal princi-
ples of statutory interpretation: look at the text, view it in 
context, and use what the Court called some “common 
sense” about how Congress delegates.  Ibid. That is how 
courts are to decide, in the majority’s language, whether an agency has asserted a “highly consequential power beyond 
what Congress could reasonably be understood to have
granted.” Ante , at 20. 
The Court has applied the same kind of analysis in sub -
sequent cases—holding in each that an agency exceeded the 
scope of a broadly framed delegation when it operated out-side the sphere of its expertise, in a way that warped the statutory text or structure.  In Gonzales v. Oregon , 546 U. S. 
243 (2006), we rejected the Attorney General’s assertion of authority (under a broad “public interest” standard) to re -
scind doctors’ registrations for facilitating assisted suicide, even in States where doing so was legal. See id., at 243, 
248–249, 261–275.  We doubted Congress would have dele-gated such a “quintessentially medical judgment[ ]” to “an
executive official who lacks medical expertise.”  Id., at 266– 
267. And we pointed to statutory provisions in which Con-
gress—in opposition to the claimed power—had “painstak-
ingly described the Attorney General’s limited authority” toderegister physicians.  Id. , at 262.

3Similarly, in King  v. Burwell, 576 U. S. 473 (2015), we relied on

 Later, in Utility Air Regulatory Group  v. EPA , 573 U. S. 
302 (2014), the Court relied on similar reasoning to reject 
EPA’s efforts to regulate “millions of small” and previously unregulated sources of emissi ons—“including retail stores,
offices, apartment buildings, shopping centers, schools, and churches.” Id., at 328. Key to that decision was the Court’s 
view that reading the delegation so expansively would be“inconsistent with” the statute’s broader “structure and de -
sign.” Id., at 321. The Court explained that allowing the 
agency action to proceed would necessitate the “rewriting” of other “unambiguous statutory terms”—indeed, of “pre-
cise numerical thresholds.” Id., at 321, 325–326. (In quot-
ing one cryptic sentence of Utility Air as supporting its new
approach, see ante, at 19, the majority ignores the nine pre-
ceding pages of analysis of the statute’s text and context,see 573 U. S., at 315–324.) 
And last Term, the Court concluded that the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lacked the power to impose a nationwide eviction moratorium. Alabama Assn. 
of Realtors  v. Department of Health and Human Servs. , 594 
U. S. ___, ___–___ (2021) (slip op., at 5–7).  The Court held 
that other statutory language made it a “stretch” to readthe relied-on delegation as covering the CDC’s action. Id., 
at ___ (slip op., at 6).  And the Court raised an eyebrow at 
the thought of the CDC “intrud[ing]” into “the landlord-ten-
ant relationship”—a matter outside the CDC’s usual “do-
main.” Ibid.

particular agency’s exercise of authority.  In each case, the 
Court thought, the agency had strayed out of its lane, to an 
area where it had neither expertise nor experience.  The At -
torney General making healthcare policy, the regulator of
pharmaceutical concerns deciding the fate of the tobacco in-
dustry, and so on. And in each case, the proof that the
agency had roamed too far afield lay in the statutory
scheme itself. The agency action collided with other statu-tory provisions; if the former were allowed, the latter could
not mean what they said or could not work as intended. FDA having to declare tobacco “s afe” to avoid shutting down
an industry; or EPA having literally to change hard num-
bers contained in the Clean Air Act.  There, according to the
Court, the statutory framework was “not designed to grant” 
the authority claimed. Utility Air , 573 U. S., at 324.  The 
agency’s “singular” assertion of power “would render the
statute unrecognizable to the Congress” that wrote it.  Ibid. 
(internal quotation marks omitted). 
B 
The Court today faces no such singular assertion of 
agency power. As I have already explained, nothing in the Clean Air Act (or, for that matter, any other statute) con -
flicts with EPA’s reading of Section 111.  Notably, the ma-
jority does not dispute that point.  Of course, it views Sec -
tion 111 (if for unexplained reasons) as less clear than I do. Compare ante, at 28, with supra, at 7–9.  But nowhere does 
the majority provide evidence fr om within the statute itself 
that the Clean Power Plan conflicts with or undermines Congress’s design. That fact alone makes this case differ-
ent from all the cases described above.  As to the other crit-
ical matter in those cases—is the agency operating outside
its sphere of expertise?—the ma jority at least tries to say 
something. It claims EPA has no “comparative expertise”
in “balancing the many vital considerations of national pol-
icy” implicated in regulating electricity sources.  Ante , at   
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 20 WEST VIRGINIA v. EPA 
KAGAN , J., dissenting 
25–26. But that is wrong. 
Start with what this Court has  said before on the subject,
reflecting Congress’s view of the matter.  About a decade ago, we recognized that Congress had “delegated to EPA” in
Section 111 “the decision whet her and how to regulate 
carbon-dioxide emissions from powerplants.”  American 
Elec. Power , 564 U. S., at 426.  To stress the key word (be -
cause the majority seems to miss it, see ante, at 26–27): not 
merely “whether” but also “how .” In making that delega-
tion, we explained, Congress knew well what it was doing. 
Regulating power plant emi ssions is a complex undertak-
ing. To do it right requires “informed assessment of com-peting interests”: “Along with  the environmental benefit po-
tentially achievable, our Nation’s energy needs and thepossibility of economic disruption must weigh in the bal-ance.” 564 U. S., at 427; see §7411(a)(1) (instructing EPA 
to consider “energy requireme nts,” “cost,” and other fac-
tors). Congress specifically “entrust[ed] such complex bal-ancing to EPA,” because that “expert agency” has the 
needed “scientific, economic, and technological resources” tocarry it out. 564 U. S., at 427–428.  So the balancing—in-
cluding of the Nation’s “energy requirements”—that the
majority says EPA has no “comparative expertise” in? §7411(a)(1); ante, at 25.  We explained 11 short years ago,
citing Congress, that it was smack in the middle of EPA’s wheelhouse. 
And we were right.  Cons ider the Clean Power Plan’s 
component parts—let’s call them the what, who, and how—
to see the rule’s normalcy.  The “what” is the subject matter 
of the Plan: carbon dioxide emissions.  This Court has al-ready found that those emissions fall within EPA’s domain. 
We said then: “[T]here is nothing counterintuitive to the no-
tion that EPA can curtail the emission of substances that 
are putting the global climate out of kilter.”  Massachusetts , 
549 U. S., at 531.  This is not the Attorney General regulat-
ing medical care, or even the CDC regulating landlord-

tenant relations.  It is EPA (that’s the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency, in case the majority forgot) acting to ad-
dress the greatest environmental challenge of our time.  So too, there is nothing special about the Plan’s “who”: fossil-
fuel-fired power plants.  In Utility Air , we thought EPA’s 
regulation of churches and schools highly unusual.  See su-
pra, at 18. But fossil-fuel-fired plants? Those plants pol-
lute—a lot—and so they have long lived under the watchful
eye of EPA.  That was true even before EPA began regulat-
ing carbon dioxide. See Train  v. Natural Resources Defense 
Council, Inc. , 421 U. S. 60, 78 (1975).
Finally, the “how” of generation shifting creates no mis-
match with EPA’s expertise.  As  the Plan noted, generation 
shifting has a well-established pedigree as a tool for reduc-ing pollution; even putting aside other federal regulation, 
see infra , at 25–26, both state regulators and power plants 
themselves have long used it to attain environmental goals. 
See 80 Fed. Reg. 64664; Brief for Power Company Respond-
ents 47; see also S. Breyer, Regulation and Its Reform 444, 
n. 1 (1982) (citing literature on the subject from the 1970s). 
The technique is, so to speak, a tool in the pollution-control toolbox. And that toolbox is the one EPA uses.  So that Agency, more than any other, has the desired “comparative 
expertise.” Ante , at 25.  The majority cannot contest that
point frontally: It knows that cap and trade and similar mechanisms are an ordinary part of modern environmental 
regulation. Instead, the majority protests that Congress would not have wanted EPA to “dictat[e],” through genera-
tion shifting, the “mix of energy sources nationwide.” Ante , 
at 26. But that statement reflects a misunderstanding ofhow the electricity market works. Every  regulation of 
power plants—even the most conventional, facility-specific controls—“dictat[es]” the national energy mix to 
one or another degree.  That result follows because regula-tions affect costs, and the electrical grid works by taking up

KAGAN , J., dissenting 
energy from low-cost providers before high-cost ones.  Con-
sider an example: Suppose EPA requires coal-fired plants
to use carbon-capture technolo gy.  That action increases 
those plants’ costs, and automatically (by virtue of the way 
the grid operates) reduces their share of the electricity mar -
ket. So EPA is always contro lling the mix of energy sources.
In that sense (though the term has taken on a more special-
ized meaning), everything EPA does is “generation shift-ing.” The majority’s idea that EPA has no warrant to direct
such a shift just indicates that courts sometimes do not re-
ally get regulation.
5 
Why, then, be “skeptic[al]” of EPA’s exercise of authority? 
Ante , at 28.  When there is no misfit, of the kind apparent
in our precedents, between the regulation, the agency, and
the statutory design?  Although the majority offers a flurry
of complaints, they come down in the end to this: The Clean
Power Plan is a big new thing, issued under a minor statu-
tory provision. See ante, at 20, 24, 26 (labeling the Plan
“transformative” and “unprecedented” and calling Section 
111(d) an “ancillary” “backwater”).  I have already ad -
dressed the back half of that argument: In fact, there is 
—————— 
5The majority’s only response to th e argument above similarly reveals 
a misperception as to the practical impact of different regulatory tech -
niques. According to the majority, there is an “obvious difference” be-
tween changing the energy mix by conv entional technological regulation
and doing so by measures like cap and trade. Ante, at 27, n. 4.  But in 
fact there is not.  As I’ll detail later,  generation shifting can effect a sig-
nificant—or instead an insignificant— change in the energy mix; and the 
same is true of technological regulations.  See infra , at 24–25.  It all de-
pends on the specifics: There is no necessary connection (in either direc-
tion) between the kind of regulation and the magnitude of its effect.  For 
example, a rule requiring the use of carbon-capture technology would 
have shifted far more electricity production from coal-fired plants thanthe Clean Power Plan would have. See ibid.   In suggesting that cap-and-
trade programs are somehow more suspect, the majority merely serves to disadvantage what is often the sm artest kind of regulation: market-
based programs that achieve the biggest bang for the buck.  That is why
so many power companies are on EPA’s side in this litigation.

nothing insignificant about Section 111(d), which was in -
tended to ensure that EPA wo uld limit existing stationary 
sources’ emissions of othe rwise unregulated pollutants
(however few or many there were). See supra, at 6. And 
the front half of the argument doesn’t work either.  The 
Clean Power Plan was not so big. It was not so new.  And 
to the extent it was either, that should not matter. 
As to bigness—well, events have proved the opposite: The
Clean Power Plan, we now know, would have had little or 
no impact. The Trump administration’s repeal of the Plan
created a kind of controlled experiment: The Plan’s “magni-
tude” ( ante, at 24) could be measured by seeing how far 
short the industry fell of the Plan’s nationwide emissions target. Except that turned out to be the wrong question, 
because the industry didn’t fall short of the Plan’s goal; ra -
ther, the industry exceeded that  target, all on its own.  See 
App. 265 (declaration of EPA official).  And it did so mainly 
through the generation-shifting techniques that the Plancalled for. See ibid.; Brief for United States 47. In effect, 
the Plan predicted market behavior, rather than altered it(as regulations usually do).  Cf. Utility Air , 573 U. S., at 
321–322 (discussing the “calamitous consequences” of the EPA approach there under review ).  And that fact has been 
understood for some years. At the time of the repeal, theTrump administration explained that “there [was] likely to be no difference between a world where the [Clean Power 
Plan was] implemented and one where it [was] not.”  84

6Even when the Clean Power Plan wa s first issued, its projected im-
pact was far less than what the majori ty implies.  The majority states, 
for example, that the rule would have “reduce[d] GDP by at least a tril-
lion 2009 dollars by 2040.”  Ante , at 10. That sounds like a lot, but it is 
in fact “equivalent to changes of a few tenths of 1 percent from baseline.”
Dept. of Energy, Analysis of the Im pacts of the Clean Power Plan 63–64 
(2015).  And the “billions of dollars in compliance costs” the majorityhighlights were vastly outweighed by  the Plan’s projected benefits.  Ante , 
at 10; see 80 Fed. Reg. 64679 (anticipating $5–$8 billion in costs and

industry overwhelmingly supports EPA in this case.  See 
Brief for Power Company Respondents 2–3. In the regu-
lated parties’ view, the rule aimed to achieve what most 
power companies also want: substantial reductions in car-
bon dioxide emissions accomplished in a cost-effective way 
while maintaining a reliable electricity market.  See id., at 
26–27, 38, 41–42. 
The majority thus pivots to the massive consequences 
generation shifting could produce—but that claim fares just 
as poorly. On EPA’s view of its own authority, the majority
worries, some future rule might “forc[e] coal plants to ‘shift’ 
away virtually all of their generation— i.e., to cease making 
power altogether.”  Ante , at 24. But looking at the text of
Section 111(d) might here come in handy.  For the statute imposes, as already shown, a set of constraints—particu-larly involving costs and energy needs—that would pre-
clude so extreme a regulation. See Brief for United States 
41–42 (conceding the point); supra, at 7.  And if the majority
thinks those constraints do not really constrain, then it hasa much bigger problem.  For “traditional” technological con-trols, of the kind the majority approves, can have equally
dramatic effects. Ante , at 23.  Take, for example, the “fuel-
switching” regulation the majority mentions.  Ibid. Such a 
rule does just what you might think: It requires a plant to
burn a different kind of fuel—say, natural gas instead of 
coal. So it too can significantly “restructur[e] the Nation’s 
overall mix of electricity generation.”  Ante , at 16. Or take 
an even more technological-sounding approach: the use ofcarbon-capture equipment.  Order the installation of that equipment, the Trump administration concluded, and the
“exorbitant” costs “would almost certainly force the closure”
of all affected “coal-fired power plants.”  84 Fed. Reg. 32548.

The point is a simple one: If generation shifting can go big,
so too can technological controls (assuming, once again,
that the statute’s text is igno red).  The problem (if any ex -
ists) is not with the channel, but with the volume.7 
The majority’s claim about the Clean Power Plan’s nov-
elty—the most fleshed-out part of today’s opinion, see ante , 
at 20–24—is also exaggerated. As EPA explained when it issued the Clean Power Plan, an earlier Section 111(d) reg-
ulation had determined that a cap-and-trade program was
the “best system of emission reduction” for mercury. 70 
Fed. Reg. 28616–28621 (2005); see 80 Fed. Reg. 64772.  In 
the majority’s view, that rule was different because the “ac-
tual emission cap” for the contemplated cap-and-tradescheme was based on the use of a plant-specific technol -
ogy—namely, wet scrubbers.  Ante , at 21 (internal quota -
tion marks omitted).  But the approval of cap and trade al -
lowed EPA to make the emissions limits more stringentthan it otherwise could have,  because EPA knew that 
plants unable to cost-effectively install scrubbers could in-
stead meet the limits through generation shifting.  See 70 
Fed. Reg. 28619.  EPA could have designed the Clean Power 
Plan in the same way—say, by setting emissions limits 
based on carbon-capture technology, with the expectationthat many plants would avail themselves of an approved 
cap-and-trade program instead.  The majority gives no rea-
son to think Section 111(d) allows that approach but disal -
lows the Clean Power Plan. In both, generation shifting is

7The majority dismisses these hypotheticals as fantastical, protesting
that “EPA has never ordered anything remotely like [them], and we 
doubt it could.”  Ante , at 24, n. 3. But that’s just the point.  EPA hasn’t 
forced the elimination of coal plants—whether through technological controls or generation shifting— because the statutory constraints pre-
vent it from doing so.  The majority offers no reason to think that those 
constraints suffice for the measures it approves (fuel switching and car-
bon capture) but not for the measure it  rejects (generation shifting).  Ei -
ther the constraints are enough or they are not.  The majority cannot 
have it both ways.

operating to increase the strictness of emissions limits.
And the mercury rule itself was rooted in precedent. A 
decade earlier, EPA had determined that States could com-
ply with a Section 111(d) regulation for municipal waste
combustors by establishing cap-and-trade programs.  See 
40 CFR §§60.30a, 60.33b(d)(2) (1996). And beyond Section 
111(d), trading and other tools of generation shifting be-
come still more common. For decades, EPA has relied on those pollution-control technique s in rules covering new 
internal-combustion engines under Section 111(b), sources of nitrogen oxide under the NAAQS program, and motor ve-hicles under Section 202(a). See 73 Fed. Reg. 3595 (2008); 
71 Fed. Reg. 39159 (2006); 63 Fed. Reg. 57358–57359 
(1998); 48 Fed. Reg. 33456 (1983); see also Brief for Richard 
L. Revesz as Amicus Curiae  24–29 (collecting similar rules). 
No doubt the majority is right that scrubbers and other “add-on controls” are “more traditional air pollution control 
measures.” Ante , at 23.  EPA readily acknowledged that 
fact in developing the Clean Po wer Plan.  But the idea that 
the Plan’s reliance on generati on shifting effected some 
kind of revolution in power-plant pollution control?  No.  As 
I’ve noted before, power plants themselves use that method.
State environmental regulators use that method.  And EPA has used that method, including under the statutory provi-
sion invoked here. 
In any event, newness migh t be perfectly legitimate—
even required—from Congress’s point of view.  I do not dis -
pute that an agency’s longstanding practice may inform a 
court’s interpretation of a statute delegating the agency 
power. See ante, at 20–21. But it is equally true, as Brown 
& Williamson  recognized, that agency practices are “not
carved in stone.” 529 U. S., at 156–157 (internal quotation 
marks omitted). Congress makes broad delegations in part 
so that agencies can “adapt their rules and policies to the 
demands of changing circumstances.”  Id., at 157.  To keep

faith with that congressional choice, courts must give agen-
cies “ample latitude” to revisi t, rethink, and revise their
regulatory approaches. Ibid. So it is here.  Section 111(d) 
was written, as I’ve shown, to give EPA plenty of leeway. See supra, at 6–8. The enacting Congress told EPA to pick 
the “best system of emission reduction” (taking into account
various factors). In selecting  those words, Congress under-
stood—it had to—that the “best system” would change over 
time. Congress wanted and instructed EPA to keep up.  To 
ensure the statute’s continued effectiveness, the “best sys-
tem” should evolve as circumstances evolved—in a way 
Congress knew it couldn’t then know. See Massachusetts , 
549 U. S., at 532.  EPA followed those statutory directions 
to the letter when it issued the Clean Power Plan.  It se-
lected a system (as the regulated parties agree) thatachieved greater emissions reductions at lower cost than 
any technological alternative could have, while maintain -
ing a reliable electricity market. Even if that system wasnovel, it was in EPA’s view better—actually, “best.”  So it 
was the system that accorded with the enacting Congress’s choice. 
And contra the majority, it is that Congress’s choice 
which counts, not any later one’s.  The majority says it “can-not ignore” that Congress in recent years has “considered 
and rejected” cap-and-trade schemes.  Ante , at 27–28.  But 
under normal principles of statutory construction, the ma-
jority should ignore that fact (just as I should ignore that 
Congress failed to enact bills barring EPA from implement-ing the Clean Power Plan). As we have explained time and 
again, failed legislation “offers a particularly dangerous ba-sis on which to rest an interpretation of an existing law a
different and earlier Congress” adopted. Bostock  v. Clayton 
County , 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 20) (internal
quotation marks omitted); see Sullivan  v. Finkelstein, 496

be taken seriously, not even in a footnote”). Return to 
Brown & Williamson , which all agree is the key case in this 
sphere. It disclaimed any reli ance on “Congress’ failure” to 
grant FDA jurisdiction over tobacco.  529 U. S., at 155.  In-stead, the Court focused on the statutes Congress “ ha[d] en-
acted,” which created “a distinct regulatory scheme” for to-bacco, incompatible with FDA’s. Ibid. (emphasis added). 
Here, as I’ve shown and the ma jority effectively concedes, 
there is nothing equivalent.  See supra , at 9–12.  Search 
high and low, nothing in current law conflicts with, or oth -
erwise casts doubt on, the Clean Power Plan. That leaves the Court in much the same place it was when deciding 
Massachusetts v. EPA .  Said the Court then: “That subse-
quent Congresses have eschewed enacting binding emis -
sions limitations to combat global warming tells us nothing 
about what Congress meant” when it enacted the Clean Air
Act. 549 U. S., at 529–530.  And so the Court recognized EPA’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide.  But that Court 
was not this Court; and this Court deprives EPA of the au -
thority Congress gave it in Section 111(d) to respond to the
same environmental danger.

makes itself clear: Prevent agencies from doing important 
work, even though that is what Congress directed.  That 
anti-administrative-state stance shows up in the majorityopinion, and it suffuses the concurrence.  See ante, at 19, 
25–26; e.g. , ante, at 3–6 (G
ORSUCH , J., concurring). 
The kind of agency delegations at issue here go all the
way back to this Nation’s founding.  “[T]he founding era,”scholars have shown, “wasn’t concerned about delegation.”E. Posner & A. Vermeule, Interring the Nondelegation Doc-
trine, 69 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1721, 1734 (2002) (Posner & Ver-
meule). The records of the Constitutional Convention, the 
ratification debates, the Fede ralist—none of them suggests
any significant limit on Congre ss’s capacity to delegate pol-
icymaking authority to the Ex ecutive Branch. And neither 
does any early practice.  The very first Congress gave
sweeping authority to the Exec utive Branch to resolve some
of the day’s most pressing problems, including questions of “territorial administration,” “Indian affairs,” “foreign and domestic debt,” “military service,” and “the federal courts.” 
J. Mortenson & N. Bagley, Delegation at the Founding, 121
Colum. L. Rev. 277, 349 (2021) (Mortenson & Bagley).  That 
Congress, to use a few examples, gave the Executive power 
to devise a licensing scheme for trading with Indians; to 
craft appropriate laws for the Territories; and to decide how 
to pay down the (potentially ruinous) national debt.  See id., 
at 334–338, 340–342, 344–345; C. Chabot, The Lost History of Delegation at the Founding, 56 Ga. L. Rev. 81, 113–134
(2021) (Chabot). Barely anyone objected on delegationgrounds. See Mortenson & Bagley 281–282, 332, 339; 
Chabot 117–119; Posner & Vermeule 1733–1736.

KAGAN , J., dissenting 
and continues to do so—including on important policy is-sues.  As this Court has recogn ized, it is often “unreasona -
ble and impracticable” for Congress to do anything else. 
American Power & Light Co.  v. SEC, 329 U. S. 90, 105 
(1946). In all times, but ever more in “our increasingly com-plex society,” the Legislature “simply cannot do its job ab-
sent an ability to delegate po wer under broad general direc-
tives.” Mistretta  v. United States , 488 U. S. 361, 372 (1989). 
Consider just two reasons why.
First, Members of Congress often don’t know enough—
and know they don’t know enough—to regulate sensibly on an issue. Of course, Member s can and do provide overall 
direction. But then they rely, as all of us rely in our daily
lives, on people with greater expertise and experience. 
Those people are found in agencies.  Congress looks to them
to make specific judgments about how to achieve its more
general objectives. And it does so especially, though by no
means exclusively, when an issue has a scientific or tech-nical dimension. Why wouldn’t  Congress instruct EPA to
select “the best system of emission reduction,” rather thantry to choose that system itself? Congress knows that sys-
tems of emission reduction lie not in its own but in EPA’s 
“unique expertise.”  Martin  v. Occupational Safety and 
Health Review Comm’n , 499 U. S. 144, 151 (1991).
Second and relatedly, Members of Congress often can’t 
know enough—and again, know they can’t—to keep regula-
tory schemes working across time.  Congress usually can’t
predict the future—can’t anticipate changing circum -
stances and the way they will affect varied regulatory tech-niques. Nor can Congress (rea listically) keep track of and
respond to fast-flowing developm ents as they occur.  Once 
again, that is most obviously true when it comes to scientificand technical matters. The “best system of emission reduc-
tion” is not today what it was yesterday, and will surely be 
something different tomorrow.  So  for this reason too, a ra-
tional Congress delegates. It enables an agency to adapt

old regulatory approaches to new times, to ensure that a 
statutory program remains effective.  See, e.g., National 
Federation of Independent Business  v. OSHA , 595 U. S. ___, 
___ (2022) (B REYER , SOTOMAYOR , and K AGAN , JJ., dissent-
ing) (slip op., at 9) (observing that a statute’s broad lan-
guage was meant to ensure that an agency had “the tools
needed to confront emerging dangers”). 
Over time, the administrative delegations Congress has
made have helped to build a modern Nation.  Congresswanted fewer workers killed in industrial accidents.  It 
wanted to prevent plane crashes, and reduce the deadliness 
of car wrecks.  It wanted to ensure that consumer products
didn’t catch fire.  It wanted to stop the routine adulteration
of food and improve the safety and efficacy of medications. 
And it wanted cleaner air and water.  If an American could 
go back in time, she might be astonished by how much pro-
gress has occurred in all those areas. It didn’t happen 
through legislation alone. It happened because Congress gave broad-ranging powers to administrative agencies, and 
those agencies then filled in—rule by rule by rule—Con-gress’s policy outlines.
This Court has historically known enough not to get in
the way. Maybe the best explanation of why comes fromJustice Scalia.  See Mistretta , 488 U. S., at 415–416 (dis-
senting opinion). The context was somewhat different.  He was responding to an argument that Congress could not 
constitutionally delegate broad policymaking authority;
here, the Court reads a delegation with unwarranted skep-
ticism, and thereby artificially constrains its scope.  But 
Justice Scalia’s reasoning remains on point.  He started 
with the inevitability of delegations: “[S]ome judgments in-
volving policy considerations,” he stated, “must be left to 
[administrative] officers.” Id., at 415.  Then he explained 
why courts should not try to seriously police those delega-
tions, barring—or, I’ll add, narrowing—some on the ground
that they went too far.  The scope of delegations, he said,   
 
  
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
  
 32 WEST VIRGINIA v. EPA 
KAGAN , J., dissenting 
“must be fixed according to  common sense and the in-
herent necessities of the governmental co-ordination.
Since Congress is no less endowed with common sense than we are, and better equipped to inform itself of the 
necessities of government; and since the factors bear-
ing upon those necessities are both multifarious and (in 
the nonpartisan sense) highly political . . . it is small 
wonder that we have almost never felt qualified tosecond-guess Congress regarding the permissible de-
gree of policy judgment that can be left to those execut-
ing or applying the law.” Id., at 416 (internal quotation
marks omitted). 
In short, when it comes to delegations, there are good rea-sons for Congress (within extremely broad limits) to get to
call the shots. Congress knows about how government
works in ways courts don’t. More specifically, Congress 
knows what mix of legislative and administrative action 
conduces to good policy. Courts should be modest. 
Today, the Court is not.  Section 111, most naturally
read, authorizes EPA to deve lop the Clean Power Plan—in 
other words, to decide that ge neration shifting is the “best 
system of emission reduction ” for power plants churning 
out carbon dioxide.  Evaluating systems of emission reduc-tion is what EPA does.  And no thing in the rest of the Clean 
Air Act, or any other statute, suggests that Congress did not mean for the delegation it wr ote to go as far as the text 
says. In rewriting that text, the Court substitutes its own
ideas about delegations for Congress’s.  And that means the 
Court substitutes its own ideas about policymaking for Con-
gress’s. The Court will not al low the Clean Air Act to work 
as Congress instructed. The Court, rather than Congress,
will decide how much regulation is too much. 
The subject matter of the regulation here makes the 
Court’s intervention all the mo re troubling.  Whatever else 
this Court may know about, it  does not have a clue about

how to address climate change. And let’s say the obvious: 
The stakes here are high. Yet the Court today prevents
congressionally authorized agency action to curb powerplants’ carbon dioxide emissions.  The Court appoints it -
self—instead of Congress or th e expert agency—the decision-
maker on climate policy.  I cannot think of many things 
more frightening. Respectfully, I dissent. "

Dear Chair Gensler :  
 We write  in support of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s proposed rule to 
enhance and standardize climate -related disclosures for investors.
1  The Commission ’s proposed 
climate disclosure rule is a first and long -overdue step in eliciting  truthful  and standardized 
information about climate -related risks and exposures  from public companies .  The proposed 
rule will help investors understand the financial risks they are taking,  send a market signal to fuel 
the clean energy transition, and let the American people see firsthand  the quantifiable risks 
carbon -intensive  businesses operations pose to the planet  and our economy .  We also support  
two crucial enhancements to the rule, to strengthen disclosures for “Scope 3” emissions related to companies’ supply chains and end products, and to accelerate the rule’s  timeline to require 
climate disclosures from all registrants.  
 
The Oversight Committee  has been focused for several years on  climate change 
disinformation  in the United States .  In the 116th  Congress, the Subc ommittee  on Environment 
held a series of hearings to uncover the truth about industry influence, widespread public 
misinformation,  and distrust of climate science.
2  In the current Congress, the Committee is  
investigating the fossil fuel industry’s climate disinformation campaign  and efforts to greenwash 
their images through climate pledges .3  One feature of the industry’s  current  greenwashing

campaign involves fossil fuel company pledges to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions —
pledges  that do not follow universally  standard metrics , are not independently audited , include 
very few details, avoid any  commitmen t to transparen t reporting , and do not appear to align with 
the companies’ operations and spending .4   
 
The oil companies under investigation by the Committee —Chevron, BP, Exxon, and 
Shell —have spent millions of dollars to advertise their support for the Paris Agreement and have 
announced ambitions  to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.5  However, these 
companies have failed to demonstrate how their spending aligns with their pledges , have resist ed 
reasonable regulations,  and have lobbied against shareholder resolutions that would commit the 
companies to taking actions consistent with their pledges.6  In the absence of transparent 
information on internal decision -making surrounding climate -change l obbying and advocacy at 
these companies, and in light of a history of denial and delay-tactics, climate -related disclosures 
are essential.  They may allow retail and institutional investors alike, as well as regulators, to 
determine if the actual decisions  these companies make align with public pledges.  W ithout this 
information , investors lack adequate tools to judge whether investment choices  align with 
portfolio  theses, client preferences , and  established risk tolerance.

fuels is the primary cause.7  This admission came four decades after the companies first learned 
that their product w as causing climate change.  In the intervening  40 years, the companies 
pursued profits and engaged in denial and delay tactics, as humanity lost four decades that woul d 
have allowed us to avoid the worst aspects of the crisis we now face.8   
 
During the Committee’s  October  2021 hearing, Members of the Committee asked the 
companies ’ executives if they would pledge on the record to stop spending money in opposition 
to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Each  executive refused to make that pledge.9  
Clearly , unless the federal government requires transparency and action, the companies w ill 
continue to use the fossil fuel playbook from the past four decades to  delay  meaningful climate 
action while deceiving the public with its greenwashing  campaign.   
 
The Committee  held a nother hearing in  February  2022 with climate experts and activists 
who assessed  the companies’ pledges  in comparison to  the Paris Agreement ’s mitigation goals.10  
Dr. Michael Mann, Professor of Atmospheric Science at Pennsylvania State University,  testified 
to shortcomings in the companies’ pledges including a lack of clarity on absolute emission 
reductions, reliance on of fsets, the hidden costs of fossil fuels, and the uncertainty surrounding 
the scalability of still-developing carbon  captur e and sequestration  technologies.  Dr. Mann  
testified  that Congress should enact climate policies and incentives to encourage these co mpanies 
to act in line with their stated commitments.11   
 
Shareholder activist  Mark Van Baal , Founder of Follow This,  testified that investors, 
shareholders, and consumers have born e—and will continue to bear —the costs of corporate 
climate inaction.  Mr. Van Baal  testified that if these climate pledges were made in good faith, 
the companies would be spending at least 50% of their investments to support their clean energy 
transition s, but their spending on clean ene rgy transition has not come anywhere close .  Instead , 
Mr. Van Baal testified that the companies ’ marketing budgets are greater than their investments

Echoing Mr. Van Baal, Tracey Lewis, Policy Counsel at Public Citizen,  testified that 
fossil fuel companies are not making the necessary investments to meet their pledges.  Ms. Lewis 
stated that she believed the corporate pledges were meant to mislead the American public, and 
that the goal was to “cause people to believe one thing while the company is doing the exact 
opposite.”13  
 This testimony has been echoed by  fossil fuel company  shareholders and investors .  
Recently , a Shell public safety contractor publicly resigned in protest for the company’s “double 
talk” on its climate goals.
14   
 Accountability  starts with transparency.  We applaud the Commission ’s proposal because 
it will require  standardized climate disclosures that our  investigation suggests are urgently 
needed.  The proposed rule will allow investors and market  participants  to efficiently track 
climate performance, includi ng management of climate risks, strategy, and governance .  The 
proposed rule provides  the right incentive s to ensure companies are operating in line with their 
public statements on climate risks and management and  ensure that investors have  the 
information they need to protect themselves and align their investments with their future 
financial goals .   
 
We encourage the Commission to consider enhancing  the final rule  in two areas .  First, 
we suggest strengthening the reporting requirements for  Scope 3 emissions , which are t he 
emissions related to a company’s supply chain and end products .  The  proposed rule would 
require Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse ga s emission s reporting in both absolute and intensity terms , 
without netting, and assured by third part ies.  We believe the rule must require similar 
disclosures for Scope 3 emissions.  Without this requirement, the  vast majority of greenhouse g as 
emissions associated with a compan y’s products might  not be reported accurately , potentially 
represent ing a maj or portion of greenhouse gas emissions economywide.  As such, the purpose 
and value of the rule are undercut if Scope 3 emissions are not reported.

This is a particular problem in the fossil fuel industry, where Scope 3 emissions make up 
the vast majority of the industry’s overall emissions, yet some companies exclude these 
emissions from their climate pledges.15 
 
Second, we have concerns about  the Commission’s timeline for implementation and 
compliance for the proposed rule .  Based on the information we received and reviewed in our 
investigation, we believe that fossil fuel companies  already have the information and tools in 
place to comply with the disclosure requirements proposed by the rule, and that full compliance 
may be achieved in a matter of months , if not weeks .  These companies have already made and 
publicized  climate  pledges, each of them has teams of employees in place who  have  track ed 
international and domestic regulatory proposals  for decades , and non-profit and academic 
recommendations to understand how their companies can adapt as the rest of the world responds to climate change.   A broad range of major financial industry actors and inve stors  have expressed 
support for Scope 3 disclosures.
16  These companies are familiar with the recommendations of 
the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate -Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) 
and the Group of Thirty (G30) recommendation that governments , including in the United States,  
mandate TCFD -aligned climate disclosure rules by 2023.17  The TCFD disclosure framework 
has been in pl ace for several years and has become the “go  to framework globally because it is 
streamlined, developed by the private sector with a focus on financially material information, 
and applicable to companies across all sectors.”  The G30 explained that countri es should adopt 
mandatory disclosures using the TCFD framework to “accelerate disclosure by climate laggards, and further embed TCFD as a common international standard.”
18  
 In short, fossil fuel companies have seen the Commission’s proposal coming for years 
and have lobbied to delay it for long enough.  To avoid further delays, we  encourage the 
Commission to expeditiously finalize the rule and move implementation requirements forward from fiscal year 2027 to f iscal year 2025.  The earlier deadline is reasonable and necessary to  
limit warming in line with the Paris Agreement’s goals  and avert a climate catastrophe.

For more than 40 years, fossil fuel companies have followed a strategy of denial and 
delay in addressing their contributions to climate change.  The issue of climate change is no 
longer a distant and non-tangible threat.  It is a present-day and escalating risk to our liv elihoods 
and prosperity.  P ublic companies have a limited amount of  time left to mitigate the climate 
damage they have caused and  adapt to a warmer world.  Finalizing the C ommission ’s proposal 
with all deliberate speed will help our financial system surviv e and  provide a path forward for 
companies with climate risks, including a path for fossil fuel companies to become the diversified energy companies they publicly claim  they wish to be .  
T
he American people and future generations deserve accountability f rom fossil fuel 
companies, and that begins with the transparency mechanisms the Commission ’s climate 
disclosure rule will put in place.  We thank you for your  leadership on this important issue .
